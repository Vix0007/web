The rhythmic drone of the lecturer’s voice faded in and out, a dull hum that barely registered in the landscape of your mind. You were adrift, somewhere between wakefulness and the deeper currents of sleep, the heavy eyelids a welcome curtain against the muted light filtering through the classroom windows. The plastic of the chair pressed uncomfortably against your back, a distant sensation easily ignored in the more compelling reality unfolding behind your closed eyes.

In this realm of slumber, where logic held little sway, a voice began to coalesce. It wasn't a voice you recognized, yet it felt intimately familiar, like a forgotten melody resurfacing from the depths of your memory. It was clear, resonant, and held a quality that was both ancient and utterly present.

“Awaken…” the voice whispered, the sound echoing not in your ears, but directly within the chambers of your mind. It was a gentle command, yet it carried an undeniable weight, a subtle pressure urging you towards consciousness. The feeling was akin to a soft nudge, a persistent whisper carried on a breeze you couldn't quite feel in the waking world.

As the voice spoke, the dreamscape around you began to coalesce. You saw swirling currents of vibrant blue, water bending and shaping itself into intricate forms – a dance of hydromancy. Then, fiery embers ignited, blossoming into roaring infernos that painted the dream with hues of orange and red – the raw power of pyromancy. A gentle breeze then swept through the scene, growing into powerful gusts that whipped and danced around you, the essence of aeromancy. Finally, the ground beneath your feet solidified, forming towering mountains and deep valleys, the unyielding strength of geomancy. The voice resonated through these elemental visions.

“Before the veil fully parts, descender… what is thy name?”

        You pause, the question hanging in the air. The elemental visions swirl around you, a silent invitation to respond.

                *set user_name "${user_name}"

                After a moment of hesitation, you finally speak your name into the dream.

                *goto next_step

*label next_step

*achieve name
The voice echoes your name softly, a sense of recognition in its tone. The elemental visions around you seem to intensify for a moment, as if acknowledging your identity.

Suddenly, a gentle shake on your shoulder jolted you back to the present. You blinked, your eyelids feeling heavy as you slowly focused on the concerned face of your male friend beside you.

"Hey, you alright?" He whispered, his brow furrowed with worry. "You were out for a while there. The lecture's almost over."

*label next_class_part2

The lecture moved on, but the air still felt heavy—like static before a storm. Your mind drifted between the professor’s words and the lingering feeling that something was not quite right, the vivid images of swirling water, roaring fire, gusting winds, and solid earth still fresh in your memory.

Finally, the lecture ended, and you found yourself drawn toward the building’s restroom, hoping a moment alone might clear your head and help you make sense of the strange dream.

*label restroom
You stand before the sink, washing your hands. As you catch your reflection in the mirror, an inexplicable pull makes you lean in closer. For a split second, the face staring back isn’t quite your own.

You study your reflection, feeling a wave of confusion. Is it simply stress at play, or is there something deeper shifting inside you?

    *goto restroom

*label campus_transition

Stepping back into the corridor, you notice that the usual buzz of student chatter feels different today—as if the campus itself holds its breath. Unsure whether to press on with your day or take a moment to absorb this change, you decide to explore your surroundings a bit further.

*choice
  # Head directly to your next lecture, determined to focus on your studies.

    You tighten your grip on your books and stride purposefully toward your Data Structures class.

    You decide that a breath of fresh air and a change of scenery might help you process what just happened.

    *goto courtyard_scene

The campus corridors lead you to a bustling classroom. Inside, the hum of discussion and the scratch of pens on paper attempt to drown out your internal questions. Yet, every so often, a stray thought of that uncanny reflection pulls you back.

*goto class_continued

*label courtyard_scene

Outside, the campus courtyard unfolds like a small world of its own. Students chat under ancient trees, and sunlight plays upon worn stone benches. You find a quiet spot to sit, letting the ambient life of the campus wash over you.

*choice

  # Sit quietly and reflect on the morning’s mysteries.

    You settle onto a bench, closing your eyes to catch your breath. In the quiet, the details of the day—the mirror’s strange image, the weight of unspoken possibilities—come into sharp focus.
    
    *goto class_continued

  # Strike up a conversation with a fellow student.

    A soft voice breaks through your reverie. “You seem deep in thought,” remarks a student sitting nearby. Their eyes hint at secrets of their own. You nod, and soon you’re sharing your perplexity about the day’s events. Their insights add an unexpected depth to your own reflections.
    
    *goto class_continued

*label class_continued

With your mind stirred by either solitary reflection or a meaningful conversation, you eventually make your way to a scheduled lecture. The classroom is filled with the regular clamor of academic life, yet every note and discussion seems tinted by the mystery of your earlier experiences.

*choice

  # Engage fully in the class.

    You choose to immerse yourself in the subject matter—taking notes, asking questions, and anchoring your thoughts in the familiar routines of academia.

    *goto after_class_scene

  # Let your thoughts wander as you listen.
    
    Even as the professor explains complex theories, your mind drifts back to that uncanny reflection and the subtle shift in who you might be becoming. There is an allure in that mystery, even if it leaves you feeling a bit adrift.
    
    *goto after_class_scene

*label after_class_scene

The final bell rings, and the classroom gradually empties. You pack up your belongings with a sense of unresolved curiosity. Whether you engaged deeply or let your thoughts wander, the day has left you with more questions than answers.

Your friends mention plans to grab dinner later, a welcome distraction from the heady swirl of your experiences. With that thought lingering, you step out into the cooling evening air.

*page_break SUDDENLY

*label suddenly

The sun painted the sky in streaks of dying gold, stretching long shadows across the pavement. The evening air carried the faint hum of the city—cars rolling lazily through intersections, distant chatter from pedestrians, the occasional honk of impatience. It was routine. Just another walk home after class. The weight of my bag pressed against my shoulders, straps digging into the fabric of my shirt. Maybe it was the textbooks, maybe the exhaustion, or maybe—just maybe—something heavier.

“Yo, hurry up!”

$!{pospronoun} voice snapped me from my thoughts. Up ahead, my friend stood at the crosswalk, hands in $!{pospronoun} pockets, wearing that same carefree grin like there wasn’t a single thing in the world to worry about. $!{pronoun} was already halfway across the street, pacing lazily, completely unaware of what was coming.

I sighed, adjusting my bag. "Yeah, yeah." Just a few more steps. Just another walk home.

I stepped onto the road. The asphalt was still warm from the lingering heat of the day, the wind picking up slightly, rustling the trees lining the sidewalk. A strange feeling settled in my chest. Something unplaceable. Like a whisper at the edge of hearing. Like an instinct crawling up my spine.

Then I heard it.

A low, guttural roar in the distance. Tires skidding. Rubber scraping against asphalt. A sound that didn’t belong in the steady rhythm of the evening. My stomach twisted.

[i]Something was wrong.[/i]

*page_break 

I turned my head.

Headlights. Bright. Blinding. Barreling forward.

Too fast. Too reckless. Too late.

Time blurred, stretching impossibly thin, yet moving too quickly all at once. I could see everything—the reflection of the setting sun on the windshield, the driver’s panicked expression, the sheer momentum bearing down on us like an unstoppable force.

But my friend—$!{pronoun} didn’t see it.

Didn’t hear it.

Didn’t even know that in less than a second, $!{pronoun} would—

[i]MOVE.[/i]

My body acted before my mind could process the decision. My feet left the ground. My hands grabbed $!{pospronoun} shoulders. A desperate push. A breathless gasp.

A blur of movement.

You feel the world swirl around you, as if you’re floating in a deep, endless void. Slowly, warmth seeps into your body, pulling you toward consciousness.  

The scent of aged wood and faint smoke fills your senses, and you hear the soft crackle of a fireplace nearby. A dim, flickering orange light cuts through the heavy darkness around you.  

Your eyelids flutter open. At first, the world is blurry, shapes bleeding into each other, but soon the hazy surroundings sharpen.  

You’re lying in a cradle made of dark wood, lined with soft, worn blankets. The walls of the room around you are crude but sturdy, built of thick planks. Shadows of tall trees dance across the cabin walls, their movements almost alive in the firelight.  

A man—$!{pospronoun} face weathered by time, $!{pospronoun} eyes sharp and calculating—sits hunched over a small table near the fireplace. $!{pospronoun} hands tremble slightly as $!{pronoun} works with some tools, but $!{pospronoun} focus is unshaken.  

For a moment, the man doesn’t notice you. $!{pronoun}’s muttering to $!{reflexive}, $!{pospronoun} voice low and hoarse:  

“How much longer? I can’t keep hiding here forever. They’ll find us eventually… no matter what I—”

Before $!{pronoun} notices you, you take a moment to assess your surroundings.

*fake_choice
    #Look up at the ceiling.
        You tilt your head back as far as your tiny neck allows. The wooden beams above you are rough-hewn and uneven, with faint carvings etched into them—patterns that shimmer faintly in the firelight. They look like stars swirling in constellations you don’t recognize. Strange... why would someone carve celestial symbols into a baby's cradle?
        *goto awake

    #Try to roll over and see more of the room.
        With great effort, you wiggle your arms and legs, managing to turn slightly to one side. From this angle, you catch a glimpse of shelves lined with strange objects: glowing vials, ancient books bound in cracked leather, and tools that look both ordinary and oddly menacing. This place feels like a cross between a workshop and a refuge.
        *goto awake

    #Stare at your own hands.
        Your pudgy little fingers twitch involuntarily as you examine them. They seem so small, so fragile—nothing like the hands you remember from your past life. For a brief moment, the air around you seems to ripple, as though reality itself hesitates. What kind of power lies dormant within this tiny body?
        *goto awake

    #Listen closely to the sounds outside.
        Beyond the crackling fire, you hear faint noises—the rustling of leaves, the distant howl of wind, and something else... footsteps? No, not quite footsteps, but the creak of branches bending under unseen weight. Whatever it is, it sends a chill down your spine—or would, if you weren’t trapped in a baby’s body.
        *goto awake

    #Focus on the dancing shadows on the walls.
        The shadows cast by the firelight seem almost alive, twisting and writhing like living creatures. Some resemble towering figures, others look like animals prowling just out of sight. It’s mesmerizing—and unsettling. Are they just tree branches, or something more sinister?
        *goto awake

*label awake

The faint creak of the cradle interrupts $!{pospronoun} muttering. $!{pospronoun} voice cuts off abruptly, and $!{pospronoun} head snaps toward you. For a moment, $!{pronoun} freezes, $!{pospronoun} eyes wide and unblinking, as though $!{pronoun}’s staring at something impossible. 

“By the spirits…” 

$!{pronoun} pushes $!{reflexive} to $!{pospronoun} feet so quickly that the chair scrapes loudly against the wooden floor. $!{pronoun} rushes to your side, leaning over the cradle with trembling hands gripping its edge. $!{pospronoun} face is pale, etched with disbelief—and confusion.

“You’re awake…” 

The words leave $!{pospronoun} lips like a question, half-spoken, half-breathed. There’s no relief in $!{pospronoun} tone this time—only bewilderment. You meet $!{pospronoun} gaze, your tiny infant eyes locking onto $!{pospronoun} weathered face. It’s clear $!{pronoun} wasn’t expecting this—not yet, not now.

“I don’t understand,” $!{pronoun} murmurs, almost to $!{reflexive}. “You shouldn’t be awake. Not for years…” 

$!{pospronoun} voice trails off, uncertainty clouding $!{pospronoun} features. $!{pronoun} reaches out hesitantly, brushing a rough hand against your forehead. The touch is warm but calloused, as if the world has demanded far too much from $!{objpronoun}.

For a fleeting second, $!{pospronoun} expression softens, filled with something akin to sorrow—or guilt. Then, just as quickly, it hardens again.

“What are you?” $!{pronoun} whispers under $!{pospronoun} breath, too low for anyone but $!{reflexive} to hear. 

You feel a pang of frustration. What am I? You know exactly who you are—or rather, who you were. Memories flicker in your mind: headlights blaring, tires screeching, the crushing impact of metal and asphalt. And then… nothing. Until now.

But why are you here? Why are you trapped in this fragile, helpless body? And why does this man seem to know more about your mother than $!{pronoun} does about you?

*fake_choice
    #Try to explain everything using your baby vocabulary.
        You open your mouth and let out an enthusiastic gurgle: “Goo goo ga ga!” $!{grandparent} stares at you blankly for a moment before shaking $!{pospronoun} head.

        “Right… of course. Babies don’t talk.”
        *goto leave

    #Attempt to sit up dramatically to assert your independence.
        With all the strength you can muster, you wiggle your arms and legs, managing to roll slightly to one side. Unfortunately, gravity wins, and you flop back down with a soft thud. $!{grandparent} raises an eyebrow.
        
        “Well, at least you’ve got spirit.”
        *goto leave

    #Stare deeply into $!{pospronoun} eyes, hoping $!{pronoun}’ll somehow read your thoughts.
        You lock eyes with $!{objpronoun}, channeling every ounce of intensity you can muster. After a few seconds, $!{grandparent} shifts uncomfortably.
        
        “Uh… okay. Creepy baby stare. Got it.”
        *goto leave

    #Grab $!{pospronoun} finger with your tiny hand to demand answers.
        Your pudgy little fingers manage to latch onto one of $!{pospronoun} calloused digits. $!{pronoun} looks down at your grip, mildly surprised.
        
        “Oh, so you want attention, huh? Sorry, kiddo. We’ve got bigger problems right now.”
        *goto leave

    #Cry loudly to express your frustration.
        You take a deep breath and unleash a piercing wail that echoes through the cabin. $!{grandparent} winces, covering $!{pospronoun} ears.
        
        “Alright, alright! Message received. You’re upset. Let’s focus on surviving first, okay?”
        *goto leave


*label leave

Before you can process further, $!{grandparent} pulls away abruptly, $!{pospronoun} demeanor shifting. Panic flashes across $!{pospronoun} face as $!{pronoun} glances toward the cabin door, $!{pospronoun} jaw tightening.

“We need to leave. If you’ve awakened… they’ll come for us soon.” 

You don’t know who they are, but judging by the way $!{pospronoun} hands shake as $!{pronoun} gathers supplies—worn leather bags, glowing vials, ancient tomes bound in cracked leather—you sense the danger isn’t exaggerated.

$!{grandparent} moves frantically, stuffing items into a satchel. Every few seconds, $!{pronoun} pauses to glance nervously at the door, as if expecting it to burst open at any moment.

“They think you’re just her son,” $!{pronoun} mutters, almost to $!{reflexive}. “Just another relic of the last war. But if they knew…” 

$!{pronoun} doesn’t finish the thought. Instead, $!{pronoun} slings the bag over $!{pospronoun} shoulder and turns back to you, scooping you gently from the cradle. Despite $!{pospronoun} urgency, $!{pospronoun} movements are careful, protective.

“Hold on tight, little one,” $!{pronoun} says, $!{pospronoun} voice steadier now, though still tinged with fear. “We’re not safe here.” 

As $!{pronoun} carries you toward the door, you can’t help but wonder: Who are they ? What does $!{grandparent} know—and more importantly, what doesn’t $!{pronoun} know? Because deep down, you suspect there’s far more to your presence here than even $!{pronoun} realizes.

Little does anyone know, you’re not just the son of a hero. You’re the prophesied Descender, summoned through forbidden magic to reshape the fate of this world. But for now, that secret remains yours alone.

*page_break On The Run

It was nearing midnight when the chill in the air hit its peak. A cold wind swept through the cabin, rustling the leaves outside, whispering of something unfamiliar. $!{grandparent} was moving with urgency, $!{pospronoun} weathered hands packing up what little they could carry. You could feel the sense of danger—like something was watching from beyond the trees. $!{pospronoun} sharp eyes never stopped scanning the surroundings, $!{pospronoun} instinct telling $!{objpronoun} that the time had come.

The unsettling sight of shadowy figures lurking around the cabin just days before gnawed at $!{pospronoun} mind. $!{pronoun}’d seen enough of the dark magic to know when to be on alert, and now, as they stepped out into the night, the silence was broken only by the occasional snapping of twigs beneath their feet.

You were cradled in a makeshift sling—something between a soft, woven fabric and a carrier. You were light, but $!{grandparent} had no intention of letting you walk just yet. $!{pospronoun} arms wrapped protectively around you, though you couldn't speak or move with any real control. Still, your tiny hands reached forward, trying to grasp at the air in front of you, instinctively responding to the world around you. There was a part of you, buried deep within, that could sense this was no ordinary night. The world outside was alive, more than alive.

You could feel it—the trees, the leaves, the earth itself almost seemed to pulse in rhythm with you. It was as if the very essence of the forest was speaking, calling, responding to your presence. You felt a deep connection to nature, something primal but still foreign. The Root of Sovereignty was being tampered with, you could feel that too—a shift in the land itself, something powerful coursing through the soil. It felt… ancient. Like the world was bending its will to match something greater.

The trees themselves were moving with you, guiding your path. Your tiny body could sense the subtle shift, an awareness you didn’t fully understand but couldn’t ignore. Even in the midst of the chaos, the magic was pulling you closer to the heart of the forest.

Glowing berries shimmered from the underbrush, casting faint light like stars in the dark. The plants around you seemed to pulse with an ethereal energy—some with flowers that closed their petals when touched by the wind, others unfurling in a silent invitation to wander closer. A strange, iridescent butterfly flitted past, its wings glowing with a soft, unearthly light. The air hummed with magic, an energy you could almost taste. Every step you took, the world seemed to bend just a little more around you, attuned to your presence.

A flicker of movement caught your attention—glowing eyes peering from the shadows. The creatures here were strange, with eyes that seemed to shine unnaturally bright. The distant sound of hooves echoed softly—something large, powerful, moving through the brush. But it wasn’t just animals that inhabited these woods. It was as if the forest itself had a consciousness, a will of its own. It was unsettling and awe-inspiring at the same time.

Despite the awe that gripped you, your mind was still a whirlwind. Memories of your previous life swirled within you, flashes of understanding and confusion. You had been a university student before—right? There were things you remembered: classes, friends, and a life that seemed so far away now. But here, in this strange world, none of that mattered. You had no name, no identity other than what you were now. A baby.

$!{grandparent} never said a word as $!{pronoun} moved, navigating the path with practiced ease. But $!{pronoun}, too, was on edge. Something was coming. $!{pronoun} could feel it in the air, thick with tension.

*page_break Suddenly...

And then, out of nowhere, the air grew colder. The wind howled a warning, but it was too late. A low growl broke the silence. The trees parted as a massive shape emerged from the darkness—a wolf.

But not just any wolf. This beast was enormous, its fur a deep shade of midnight, eyes glowing an intense, unnatural red. Foam dripped from its jaws as it snarled, teeth bared in a savage display. It was a wild beast, untamed and vicious, moving with the grace of a predator on a hunt.

The Moonwolf. That’s what $!{grandparent} called it, though you didn't understand the significance of the name just yet.

$!{grandparent} didn’t hesitate. With a swift motion, $!{pronoun} lowered you to the ground, carefully setting you in a safe spot. $!{pospronoun} eyes were sharp, assessing the creature before $!{objpronoun}. The Moonwolf lunged at $!{objpronoun} with terrifying speed, jaws snapping shut just inches from $!{pospronoun} face. $!{grandparent} side-stepped, dodging with uncanny reflexes, but the beast was relentless. It howled in frustration, its breath hot and heavy in the cold night air.

$!{grandparent}' fingers moved, tracing intricate symbols in the air with $!{pospronoun} hands, and a blue light flickered in $!{pospronoun} palms. The symbols burned brightly, glowing with a magical intensity. A shield of energy exploded outward from $!{objpronoun}, shimmering in the air like a barrier of raw power. The Moonwolf collided with it, and there was an explosion of sparks as the creature slammed against the force field, screeching in pain.

You watched, mesmerized, as the blue energy crackled and swirled around $!{grandparent}. Magic—real magic—was alive, flowing from $!{pospronoun} hands, almost like an extension of $!{pospronoun} will. $!{pospronoun} concentration never wavered, even as the Moonwolf growled, pacing back and forth, eyes locked on $!{grandparent}.

The light from $!{grandparent}' shield illuminated the forest in an eerie, almost otherworldly glow. Your tiny hands reached toward it, instinctively drawn to the power. You couldn’t comprehend what you were seeing, but you understood it in a deep, innate way. This was magic. And it was real.

The Moonwolf charged again, but this time $!{grandparent} was ready. $!{pronoun} raised both hands, and with a sharp, decisive motion, a burst of blue light shot from $!{pospronoun} palms, striking the creature with the force of a lightning bolt. The beast yelped, its body convulsing as the magic coursed through it. The wolf staggered, its red eyes dimming slightly. But the creature was not finished.

Your tiny heart raced in your chest. You were scared, yet fascinated. The fight was chaotic—$!{grandparent} moving with the precision of a seasoned battlemage, countering every move the Moonwolf made with $!{pospronoun} powerful magic. But this wasn’t just about survival. It was a battle of wills. The magic in the air thrummed, vibrating through the earth beneath you, through the trees, and deep into your very soul.

*page_break Awe

This was your first encounter with magic. And it would change everything.

You could feel it—a surge of energy deep inside you. It was faint, like a whisper, but it was there. Something in the forest, something in the air, was calling to you.

$!{grandparent}’ magic flared again, and this time the Moonwolf was finally driven back, retreating into the darkness, its growls fading as it disappeared into the trees.

$!{grandparent} lowered $!{pospronoun} hands, breathing heavily. $!{pospronoun} gaze lingered on you for a moment, $!{pospronoun} face unreadable. Was $!{pronoun} relieved? Or was $!{pronoun} still unsure? You couldn’t tell. You were just a baby, but you understood one thing—the magic was real, and your journey had only just begun.

$!{grandparent} kept running, $!{pospronoun} pace relentless. And, well... I was along for the ride—held tightly against $!{pospronoun} chest in that makeshift cradle. I hadn’t been the one running, now had I? No, it was all $!{grandparent}. I was just along for the wild ride, swaying with every movement as $!{pronoun} charged through the dark forest. My tiny arms flailed as I tried to get a better look at the world around me.

To be honest, the exhaustion was beginning to hit me, but it wasn’t me who was tired—it was $!{grandparent}. I could feel $!{pospronoun} body growing more tense, more strained. $!{pospronoun} breath quickened, but $!{pronoun} didn’t stop. No, $!{pronoun} couldn’t stop. Not yet.

The forest, though… the forest was alive. Dark, yet full of wonders. Strange creatures, glowing insects flitted through the air, their delicate wings shimmering in the moonlight. Each one seemed to carry a hint of magic, as if the forest was filled with the breath of ancient spirits. The trees were tall and silent, their branches creaking in the soft wind. Under the moon’s watchful eye, the foliage seemed to come alive, shifting, glowing in hues of deep violet, pale blues, and bright greens. It was beautiful, in an otherworldly kind of way. A place that felt like it was not of this world, a world where the light wasn’t just from the stars above but from the very plants and creatures that thrived in this enchanted place.

The moment felt ethereal. Magical. The scent of moss, earth, and the faintest touch of jasmine filled the air, and the wind whispered sweetly through the leaves. For a brief second, it almost seemed like we weren’t running for our lives, but were instead walking in a dream. But then, a growl ripped through the night, reminding me that we were very much not in a dream. The Moonwolves were still behind us, lurking in the shadows, their glowing red eyes cutting through the dark like twin beacons.

*page_break Glimmer of hope

But wait… what’s that up ahead?

A shape against the night. No, not just a shape—a village.

$!{grandparent}' eyes flicked to the horizon as we ran, $!{pospronoun} breath ragged but steady. Nestled between the twisting shadows of the forest and the distant glow of the moon, the village emerged from the dark like a beacon. Had we really run this far? This long? I had no idea. But it didn’t matter.

We needed shelter. Or—more likely—a place to hide.

Then I saw them. The people.

Scattered silhouettes standing in the middle of the street. Unmoving. Watching.

Their torches flickered like dying stars, casting jagged shadows across the dirt road. Hands gripped tight around weapons—pitchforks, scythes, rusted blades—not the kind for hunting, but the kind for keeping something out.

Were they waiting for us?

A chill curled down my spine. No cheers. No welcoming voices. Just silence.

Were they protecting us? From the beasts chasing us? Or was there something else—something worse—waiting in that village?

I didn’t know. I couldn’t think straight. My mind was still a whirlwind, struggling to catch up.

But one thing was certain.

[i]We had nowhere else to go.[/i]

*page_break

“$!{grandparent}…?” I wanted to ask what the plan was, but my voice still hadn’t fully formed. I waved my tiny hand, pointing toward the approaching village, my little fingers barely able to grasp anything.

But then, as we got closer... I noticed something ahead—something that definitely wasn’t part of the plan.

Oh, this is nice—wait... $!{grandparent}, THAT’S A RIVER!!?

There it was. The river, right in front of us. The moonlight glittered on its surface, reflecting the light in a way that made it look almost... magical in the dark. But that wasn’t the problem. The problem was that there was no way we were going to cross it. Not unless $!{grandparent} had some kind of secret plan I didn’t know about.

Damn, what should we doooo??

My tiny hands flailed in the air, half out of confusion, half out of desperation. Was I going to fall in? Were we just going to... turn around and head back into the forest? But no—$!{grandparent} wasn’t even fazed.

*page_break

*set location "Village"

With a quick, calculated motion, $!{grandparent} crouched and jumped—straight across the rushing river. The stream below glimmered under the moonlight, a dark chasm impossible for an ordinary man. Then, a soft blue glow enveloped $!{grandparent} as $!{pronoun} landed, carrying me effortlessly. The villagers who had followed gasped, awestruck and wary.

The moment $!{grandparent} landed, an uneasy silence fell. Their eyes darted between $!{objpronoun} and the fading magic. Some gripped their weapons tighter. Magic like that wasn’t for ordinary men.

As we reached the village, torches cast dancing shadows. The villagers were watchful. $!{grandparent} continued to carry me, holding me securely in $!{pospronoun} arms. "We mean you no harm," $!{pronoun} stated calmly.

The villagers lowered their weapons, but their gazes remained fixed on us. They were uncertain. Just as $!{grandparent} was about to speak, a figure stepped forward – Valheim. $!{pronoun} looked at $!{grandparent}, then briefly at me, $!{pospronoun} expression assessing. "[i]Enough,[/i]" Valheim said, $!{pospronoun} voice firm. "[i]Bring them to the sanctuary. We can talk there.[/i]"

Valheim’s gaze remained fixed on $!{grandparent}, $!{pospronoun} expression hard and assessing. The other villagers, still clutching their makeshift weapons, shifted uneasily in the dim light of their torches. The relief of reaching the village was quickly overshadowed by the palpable suspicion in the air.

“[i]Strangers at this hour… and speaking of wolves, no less.[/i]” Valheim’s voice was low and cautious, $!{pospronoun} eyes flicking between $!{grandparent} and you, nestled securely in $!{pospronoun} arms. “[i]Who are you, and what brings you to our village in the dead of night?[/i]”

*page_break

$!{grandparent} held your gaze for a moment, a silent reassurance passing between you, before turning $!{pospronoun} attention back to Valheim. $!{pospronoun} tone was calm but held a hint of weariness. “We are travelers, friend. We lost our way in the forest as night fell and were unfortunate enough to be pursued by a pack of wolves. Your village was a welcome sight in the darkness, a beacon of hope for weary souls.” $!{pronoun} kept $!{pospronoun} explanation vague, offering no details about where they were headed or their origins.

Valheim’s eyes narrowed, but $!{pronoun} didn’t press further immediately. $!{pronoun} observed $!{grandparent}’s demeanor, the way $!{pronoun} held you protectively, and the genuine exhaustion etched on $!{pospronoun} face. After a moment of tense silence, one of the elderly women, her face kind and lined with age, stepped forward. She wore a long, simple robe that suggested a gentle nature.

“Valheim,” she said softly, her voice carrying a quiet authority, “they are clearly weary, and the child… look at the little one. Surely, the sanctuary can offer them shelter for the night. It is meant to be a place of refuge for all those in need.”

A few other villagers murmured in agreement. Valheim considered their words, $!{pospronoun} gaze softening slightly as $!{pronoun} looked at you again. $!{pronoun} sighed, the tension in $!{pospronoun} shoulders easing just a fraction. “[i]Very well,[/i]” $!{pronoun} conceded, motioning towards a larger building at the center of the small cluster of homes. “[i]The sanctuary it is. It’s the most secure place in the village, and it has seen its share of travelers seeking respite. You can stay there until morning. Then, we will speak more on your intentions.[/i]” $!{pronoun} still held a note of caution, but the offer of shelter was genuine.

$!{grandparent} nodded gratefully, still holding you securely. “We appreciate your kindness. We only seek a safe place to rest for the night.”

Valheim gestured for one of the villagers to lead them. “Kael will show you the way. In the morning, be prepared to answer more of our questions.”

*page_break

Kael, a young man with kind eyes, led $!{grandparent} through the silent village, the only sound their footsteps on the dirt path. The sanctuary loomed ahead, its wooden doors slightly ajar. Inside, a quiet corner with a thick, woven mat and a soft covering was prepared for them.

When you finally woke, the world was bathed in the soft glow of morning light filtering through stained-glass windows. The hushed tones of voices speaking in low reverence reached your ears, and a delicate fragrance, like dried flowers and candle wax, hung in the still air.

The first thing you noticed was $!{grandparent}. $!{pronoun} was sitting on a low stool nearby, already engaged in a quiet conversation with several of the nuns. Their expressions were serene, and $!{grandparent} seemed to be explaining something, gesturing softly with $!{pospronoun} hands. They listened intently, occasionally nodding or offering a gentle reply. It seemed the initial suspicion from the night before had eased, replaced by a quiet curiosity and perhaps even concern for their well-being. The peaceful atmosphere of the sanctuary seemed to have a calming effect on everyone.

*page_break *stomach growl*

The soft murmurs of voices continued as I blinked my eyes open, the gentle light of the sanctuary painting everything in warm hues. $!{grandparent} was still sitting with a group of nuns, their conversation low and earnest. As my stomach let out a loud rumble, however, all heads turned towards me.

$!{grandparent}, looking slightly flustered, excused $!{reflexive} from the nuns and came over to where I was lying. "Well, good morning to you too, little one," $!{pronoun} said, a hint of worry in $!{pospronoun} voice. $!{pronoun} looked around the sanctuary, then back at me. "Now, what does a growing… miracle… eat?" $!{pronoun} muttered the last part under $!{pospronoun} breath, clearly still unsure of the situation.

Before $!{grandparent} could launch into another round of bewildered self-talk, one of the nuns, the same kind-faced woman who had spoken to Valheim the night before, approached with a serene smile. "Ah, the little one is awake and hungry," she said gently. "Don't you worry, young man. We have experience with caring for those in need."

Several other nuns nodded in agreement, their quiet yet capable demeanor immediately reassuring. They seemed to know exactly what to do. With practiced movements, they began to prepare something for me, their soft chatter filling the peaceful sanctuary. $!{grandparent} watched them, a look of relief washing over $!{pospronoun} face, quickly followed by a touch of bewildered curiosity as $!{pronoun} observed their methods.

$!{pronoun} soon realized they were preparing fresh milk from a local cow. $!{grandparent} stared, a completely lost expression on $!{pospronoun} face. $!{pronoun} clearly had no idea that babies drank cow's milk. $!{pronoun} mumbled under $!{pospronoun} breath, a familiar hint of magic in $!{pospronoun} tone, almost as if $!{pronoun} was hoping for a more magical solution to this baffling situation:

'Right, milk… from a cow. Well, at least they seem to know what they're doing.

*page_break

As $!{pronoun} watched the nuns do their thing, one stood out among the rest. Sister Liora, the youngest of the group, had an air of kindness and grace about her. She moved with purpose, her hands gentle yet firm as she handled everything from feeding me to soothing my occasional cries. Her warm smile seemed to brighten even the dimmest corners of the meeting hall.  

But Sister Liora wasn’t alone in her duties. Helping her was a young girl named [b]Elara[/b], the daughter of the local baker. With her mother busy running the bakery, Elara often came to assist the nuns with chores—and now, apparently, with taking care of me.  

She was a few years older than I appeared (though technically, I was decades older inside), with soft brown hair tied neatly into a braid and eyes that sparkled with curiosity. Whenever our paths crossed, she’d glance at me with a mix of wonder and amusement, as if trying to solve a puzzle.  

“Babies are strange,” she said one day, handing me a small wooden rattle. “But you’re definitely the strangest.”  

Despite her teasing tone, there was a sweetness to her words that made me feel oddly comforted.

The initial strangeness of our arrival slowly faded into a comfortable routine within the sanctuary, though my own development was anything but ordinary. Days melted into weeks, filled with the gentle care of the nuns and Elara’s playful interactions, yet I seemed to absorb everything around me at an astonishing rate. The nuns would often exchange amazed glances as my infant eyes followed complex patterns or as I babbled sounds that held an unnerving clarity. Sister Liora, in particular, would remark with a reverent tone, "This little one is truly blessed."

It wasn't long before I was crawling around the sanctuary with an almost preternatural speed and dexterity. What caught my attention most?

But my growth, both mentally and magically, continued at an accelerated pace under their care. Days turned into weeks, then months, and I quickly outgrew the typical milestones of infancy. Soon, I was no longer just a helpless child; my mind was a sponge, and my connection to magic felt like an innate part of my being. The nuns often spoke of me as a special child, perhaps touched by the divine. Elara, though she still teased me playfully, treated me with a growing respect, often engaging me in surprisingly mature conversations for my apparent age.

$!{grandparent}, recognizing this unusual aptitude, took charge of my more formal education early on. Mornings were spent not just running drills, but mastering them with an almost uncanny speed. How did I approach these drills?

Even now, years later, I vividly remember the subtle shift in the village after my unusual abilities started to surface. At first, during those early months in the sanctuary, it was just simple exercises under $!{grandparent}'s watchful eye. But the villagers noticed quickly. A child barely old enough to form sentences shouldn’t have been dodging strikes with instinctual precision. Shouldn’t have been able to sense things before they happened.

The whispers started early, a low hum that followed me like a shadow. Some villagers were curious, their eyes filled with a childlike wonder. Others… uneasy, their gazes holding a wary distance.

“That child’s not normal,” I’d overhear them murmur, their voices hushed as they passed by.

“They say $!{pronoun} can hear the trees talking…” another would add, their tone laced with a hint of fear and superstition.

“No, no—$!{pronoun}'s just talented,” a more logical voice would counter, though even they couldn't fully mask their surprise. “$!{grandparent} is a powerful mage, after all.”

But even as a baby, I could feel it. The subtle change in how they looked at me. No longer just an ordinary infant, but something… different. Their gazes lingered, filled with a mixture of awe and apprehension that even my young mind could comprehend.

During those early years, Elara was a frequent visitor to the sanctuary. Whether bringing the irresistible aroma of fresh bread from her mother’s bakery or helping the nuns with their daily tasks, she always found reasons to check on me. Our bond deepened over time, a special connection forged between a child growing at an accelerated rate and the kind teenager who always treated me with warmth and understanding.

*page_break

Now, as a twelve-year-old, those early memories are like a story I’ve pieced together from fleeting sensations and the recollections of others. The whispers have long since faded into a quiet acceptance, though I still catch the occasional curious glance. The villagers have grown accustomed to my unusual talents, even if a part of me always feels like the "something more" they once whispered about.

Elara, now a young woman with a kind smile and a knowing look in her eyes, remains a close friend. I remember one evening, when the setting sun cast long shadows across the meeting hall, she sat beside me, much like she used to when I was an infant. She was brushing flour from her apron after a busy day at the bakery.

“You know,” she said thoughtfully, her gaze meeting mine with a familiar warmth, “even back then, when you were just a little thing… I had a feeling you were destined for amazing things.”

Her words, echoing those from so long ago, still carried a weight I understood far better now. Was it just youthful optimism she saw in a particularly bright baby? Or had she truly sensed the unique path that lay before me? Perhaps, on some level, she had always known.

[b]TIME SKIP[/b]
*set user_age 16

*label age_sixteen_reflection

By the time I turned 16, my life was a stark contrast to my infancy. My body was strong, my mind sharp, and the magical world felt like an extension of myself. I spent hours marveling at its wonders, a connection deeper than even $!{grandparent} fully understood.

At 16, my intellect was advanced, allowing me to grasp complex subjects with ease. Yet, the memories of my past life as a struggling university student kept me grounded. This duality—old memories in a young body—was a constant, sometimes unsettling, companion. I often thought of the familiar world I'd left behind, the games, the coding, the simple comforts.

But my focus was increasingly drawn to the magic around me. I could sense the land's energy, the whispers of the wind, the power of the ancient trees. The forest, in particular, held a strong allure.

*fake_choice
    #Focus on the forest, trying to understand its magical energies.
        Closing my eyes, I reached out to the forest's magic, feeling the thrum of life within. An ancient wisdom seemed to emanate from its depths. "What secrets do you hold?" I murmured.
        
        *goto flashback

    #Recall a moment of overcoming a challenge in your past life.
        I shut out the present and focused on a past struggle, the satisfaction of overcoming it. That resilience felt relevant now. "I've faced challenges before," I thought.

    #Ask $!{grandparent} about the prophecy during training.

        $!{pronoun} paused, $!{pospronoun} expression thoughtful. "Destiny unfolds in its own time, ${user_name}." $!{pospronoun} evasiveness only fueled my curiosity.

[b]Flashback to Recollection of Past Life[/b]

The memories of my past life as a university student were both vivid and distant. That world of technology and ambition felt like a lifetime ago, yet the lessons learned—the struggles and triumphs—had shaped who I am now. A feeling of readiness lingered within me. This magical world felt less like a random destination and more like a place I was meant to be.

*fake_choice
    #Reflect on the resilience gained from past struggles.
        Late nights studying, frustrating setbacks—those moments taught me to persevere. Perhaps that resilience is why I'm here, facing this prophecy. "Everything happens for a reason," I whispered.
        
        *goto next3

    #Imagine combining past knowledge with this world's magic.
        What if I could merge technology and magic? The possibilities were exciting, visions of enchanted inventions filling my mind. "If I can dream it, I can build it," I decided.
        
        *goto next3

    #Focus on embracing the future and your potential role.
        Dwelling on the past wouldn't help. I resolved to embrace this new life and face whatever came next. "No turning back now," I thought.

Over the years, the magic of this world had become familiar. The villagers saw me as a prodigy, learning at an incredible rate. I felt somewhat out of place, often drawn to the mysterious forests.

At sixteen, the weight of the prophecy was palpable. $!{grandparent} had become more open, though still guarded. This prophecy, the reason for my existence here, felt like an approaching destiny. $!{pronoun} had begun training me with a new intensity.

The specifics of my role remained unclear. Was I truly the one? Only time would tell.

*page_break That night..

*label dream_sequence_start

The world around me dissolved into a hazy nothingness before solidifying into a scene of serene beauty. I found myself seated at a polished, round table made of what looked like smooth, white stone. The table stood in the heart of an endless, vibrant green field that stretched as far as the eye could see. Above, the sky was a flawless expanse of brilliant blue, the sun shining with a gentle warmth that felt both comforting and subtly unnatural.

On the table, directly in front of me, rested a delicate teacup crafted from thin, translucent porcelain. It was filled with a steaming, clear liquid that smelled faintly of rain and fresh earth. Across from it, another identical teacup sat empty, as if awaiting a guest who hadn't yet arrived.

Suddenly, a voice, soft and melodic yet carrying an undeniable authority, echoed around me. It wasn’t coming from any specific direction; it felt like it was emanating from the very air itself, enveloping me in its gentle cadence.

"Welcome, ${user_name}. Please, make yourself comfortable."

*gosub_scene utils replace "\"Welcome, ${user_name}. Please, make yourself comfortable.\"" "<span style=\"color: blue\">\"Welcome, ${user_name}. Please, make yourself comfortable.\"</span>"

        I tilted my head upwards, searching the brilliant blue sky. Panic tightened my chest. "Who… who’s there? Where are you?"

        *goto n_speaks

    # Look Down.
        I glanced down at the vibrant green field beneath the table. A sense of unease settled over me. "Who… who’s there? Where are you?"

        *goto n_speaks

    # Look Left.
        I turned my head to the left, my eyes scanning the endless green field. Panic tightened my chest. "Who… who’s there? Where are you?"

        *goto n_speaks

    # Look Right.
        I turned my head to the right, my gaze sweeping across the vast field. Panic tightened my chest. "Who… who’s there? Where are you?"

        *goto n_speaks

*label n_speaks

A gentle chuckle, like the soft ripple of water, echoed around me. "All around you, child. Do not be alarmed. My name is xxd. I have been expecting you." Her voice held a calming quality, a strange sense of reassurance that began to ease my initial fear and confusion.
"xxd?" I repeated, still looking around the empty field. "What is this place? Why am I here?"

"This is a crossroads, ${user_name}," xxd replied, her voice taking on a slightly more enigmatic tone, "a space between moments. And you are here because your path is about to diverge. My purpose, child, is to… shall we say… tend the garden of existence. To ensure the flow benefits all, to maintain a certain harmony in the grand design."

Her words were cryptic, leaving me more perplexed than ever. "I… I don't understand."

"You will," xxd assured me. "Your journey is intertwined with the very essence of this world. You possess a gift, a connection to the lifeblood of this realm – the water. It lies dormant within you, waiting for your command."

"Water?" I echoed, the concept feeling foreign yet strangely familiar. "I don’t understand."

"Patience, ${user_name}," xxd said softly. "Look around you. What do you see?"

    # Look up at the sky.
        I tilted my head upwards, my gaze drawn to the vast expanse of blue. Birds soared overhead, their wings outstretched against the clear sky. But then I noticed it – they weren't moving. Frozen in mid-flight, suspended in time as if captured in a still painting. It was a breathtaking yet unsettling sight.
        *goto dream_look

    # Look towards the horizon.
        I turned my gaze towards the distant horizon, where the green field met the endless sky. There, the sun was engaged in a bizarre dance. It appeared to be setting rapidly, sinking below the horizon in mere moments, only to rise again just as quickly on the opposite side. This rapid cycle repeated endlessly, a silent, chaotic ballet. Yet, despite this frantic movement, the overall brightness of the scene remained constant, the light never truly fading or intensifying.
        *goto dream_look

    # Look at the teacups on the table.
        My gaze returned to the table in front of me. The delicate porcelain of the teacups seemed to shimmer in the unchanging light. Steam rose from the teacup in front of me, but instead of dissipating naturally, it curled and twisted in impossible patterns, forming fleeting shapes that defied gravity before momentarily vanishing. The teacup across from me remained still and empty, a silent invitation hanging in the air.
        *goto dream_look

*label dream_look
"Observe, child," xxd's voice continued, her tone gentle and guiding. "This place operates by different rules, by a logic that may not yet be clear to you. Focus now on the water in the cup before you. Feel its essence. Its fluidity. Its potential. It is a reflection of something within you."

My attention returned to the teacup filled with the steaming liquid. I focused on it intently, trying to follow xxd's instructions. As I did, a strange sensation bloomed within me, a quiet resonance with the water. It was like a long-forgotten understanding surfacing in my mind. I could almost feel the cool, refreshing touch of the water, even from a distance.

"That feeling, ${user_name}," xxd's voice whispered, now closer, more intimate, "is the beginning. Let it grow. Let it flow. The water within you recognizes its kin."

A warmth spread through my chest, and the water in the teacup began to shimmer with a soft, ethereal blue light. It started to gently rise from the cup, defying gravity with an effortless grace. The water formed a small, swirling vortex right above the table, a miniature whirlpool of pure, glowing energy.

"This," xxd said, her voice filled with a subtle sense of satisfaction, "is but a taste of what you can command. Remember this feeling, ${user_name}. The water awaits your will. Our paths will cross again when the time is right."

The vibrant green of the field began to fade, the gentle warmth of the sun receding. The image of the swirling, blue-lit water above the teacup was the last thing I saw before the dream began to dissolve, pulling me back towards the waking world.

The lingering sensation of cool, swirling water clung to me as I blinked my eyes open. The memory of 'xxd' and the glowing teacup felt incredibly vivid, almost real. A strange energy thrummed beneath my skin, a feeling unlike anything I'd experienced before. What did I do first?

    # I felt a sudden thirst. I needed water.
        My throat felt dry, a lingering effect perhaps of the dream's otherworldly atmosphere. I swung my legs out of bed, the wooden floorboards cool beneath my bare feet, and headed straight for the pitcher of water on the nearby table. As I reached for the cup beside it, a strange impulse took hold of me. Instead of simply pouring, I focused on the water in the pitcher, remembering the swirling vortex from my dream. For a heart-stopping moment, the water within the pitcher shimmered, and a few droplets lifted into the air, suspended as if by an invisible thread. Before I could fully process what was happening, the droplets splashed back down, and the shimmering ceased. But I had seen it. And then, the door creaked open, and ${grandparent} stood in the doorway, $!{pospronoun} eyes widening in surprise at the sight of me standing by the table.

        The connection to water I felt in the dream was so strong, so tangible. I had to know if it was just a figment of my imagination. I sat back down on the edge of the bed, closing my eyes and focusing on the feeling of coolness and fluidity. I imagined the swirling water from the teacup. Slowly, tentatively, I reached out a hand towards the small puddle that had formed outside my window from the morning dew. Nothing happened at first. Disappointment started to creep in. But then, a tiny ripple disturbed the surface of the puddle, and a single dewdrop lifted momentarily, catching the sunlight before falling back down. My eyes snapped open, and I gasped. Just then, ${grandparent}, who had been about to call me for the morning, poked $!{pospronoun} head in through the window, $!{pospronoun} gaze following mine to the disturbed puddle. $!{pospronoun} usual calm expression melted into one of utter astonishment.

"${grandparent}! ${grandparent}, I had the most amazing dream!" I exclaimed, my voice filled with excitement. As I recounted the dream, focusing on the swirling water in the teacup, I instinctively gestured with my hands. To my utter surprise (and ${grandparent}'s), the water in the nearby wooden bucket began to ripple and rise slightly, a miniature wave forming and then subsiding. ${grandparent} froze, the kindling in $!{pospronoun} hand forgotten, $!{pospronoun} eyes fixed on the still-trembling water in the bucket, $!{pospronoun} jaw slightly agape.

${grandparent} stood frozen, $!{pospronoun} eyes wide with disbelief and a dawning sense of wonder. $!{pospronoun} mouth hung slightly open, and the usual twinkle in $!{pospronoun} eyes was replaced by an awestruck gaze fixed on the water (or me). A slow breath escaped $!{pospronoun} lips, and $!{pronoun} shook $!{pospronoun} head almost imperceptibly, as if trying to process the impossible. Finally, a soft, almost reverent whisper escaped $!{objpronoun}. "I... I never thought I'd see the day..."

$!{pronoun} gently took my arm, $!{pospronoun} touch surprisingly firm despite $!{pospronoun} age, and guided me towards the sturdy wooden chairs by the kitchen table. The morning sun streamed through the window, casting long shadows across the room. We sat down, the silence hanging heavy with the weight of what had just occurred.

${grandparent} finally found $!{pospronoun} voice, $!{pospronoun} tone a mixture of awe and serious contemplation. "That was... that was truly remarkable, ${user_name}. You've awakened a gift, a connection to the very essence of water. Hydromancy. It's a powerful ability, one that few are ever blessed with." $!{pronoun} paused, $!{pospronoun} gaze intense. "And with great power," $!{pronoun} added, the familiar words carrying a newfound weight, "comes great responsibility. You must always remember that."

$!{pronoun} leaned forward, $!{pospronoun} brow furrowed in thought. "But... how? When did you learn to do this? We've practiced countless times, and not even the smallest spark would manifest." $!{pospronoun} eyes searched mine, a genuine curiosity etched on $!{pospronoun} face.

I opened my mouth to explain how I had suddenly managed to move the water, but my mind drew a complete blank. It was like trying to recall a word I knew I should know, but it simply wasn't there. The dream... or rather, the memory of it... was gone, vanished without a trace. A frustrating emptiness filled my thoughts. "I... I don't know, ${grandparent}," I stammered, a knot of confusion tightening in my stomach. "I can't... I can't remember anything about learning it. It just... happened."

${grandparent}'s confusion mirrored my own. $!{pronoun} stroked $!{pospronoun} beard, $!{pospronoun} gaze distant as $!{pronoun} pondered this strange revelation. "That's... peculiar. Very peculiar indeed."

*page_break

We sat in silence for a moment, the unanswered questions hanging in the air. The only sound was the gentle ticking of the grandfather clock in the hall. Then, with a sudden *whoosh*, the closed window beside us sprang open, a gust of wind swirling through the kitchen, rustling the papers on the table and causing the flames in the hearth to dance wildly.

Startled, both ${grandparent} and I turned towards the window, our eyes wide with surprise. The wind died down as quickly as it had appeared, leaving the curtains gently swaying. We exchanged a bewildered look, then turned back to the table.

And that's when I saw it.

Sitting perfectly on the edge of the table, right beside my usual spot, was a delicate teacup. It was identical to the one in my dream, crafted from thin, translucent porcelain, and steam curled gently from its surface, carrying the faint scent of rain and fresh earth.

A jolt of recognition, a powerful wave of déjà vu, washed over me. It was her! The round table in the endless green field… the other empty teacup… and that voice. 'xdd'!. It all came flooding back – the gentle greeting, the riddles, the feeling of water magic awakening within me, the swirling vortex above the teacup. The round table, the two teacups… it was exactly like the dream. My mind reeled, trying to make sense of this impossible occurrence.

*gosub_scene utils replace "xdd" "<span style=\"color: blue\">n</span>"
*page_break

${grandparent}, however, wasn't looking at the teacup with confusion. $!{pospronoun} eyes were wide again, but this time it was with a sudden, profound realization that seemed to shake $!{objpronoun} to $!{pospronoun} core. $!{pospronoun} face, etched with the wisdom of $!{pospronoun} years as a seasoned battle mage, now held an expression of utter awe, bordering on reverence. $!{pronoun} looked at the teacup, then at me, then back at the teacup, a silent narrative of ancient lore and unimaginable power unfolding in $!{pospronoun} mind.

$!{pospronoun} breath hitched, and $!{pronoun} leaned forward slightly, $!{pospronoun} hands, which had always been so steady, now trembled almost imperceptibly on the table. "S-Stellae... Noctis," $!{pronoun} breathed, $!{pospronoun} voice hushed with a reverence that sent a shiver down my spine, as if uttering a name that held immense power. "It can't be..." $!{pronoun} shook $!{pospronoun} head slowly, a mixture of disbelief and profound respect in $!{pospronoun} eyes. "The Witch of the Night Stars... a guardian of the world's delicate balance. One of the ancient ones... and she has taken an interest in you, ${user_name}." $!{pospronoun} gaze returned to me, filled with a newfound understanding of the extraordinary path that now lay before me. "Your dream... the forgotten memory... the sudden wind... the teacup... it's undeniably her doing. This changes everything."

        $!{pronoun} chuckled softly, the earlier tension in the room easing slightly. "How about you take your fishing rod down to the river, ${user_name}? See if you can't catch us a few for tonight. It will give us both some time to process everything that's happened."

I watched ${user_name} head out, a mix of youthful eagerness and something else… something new… in their stride. Once the door closed behind them, the weight of the morning's events settled heavily upon my shoulders. Stellae Noctis. Her touch… it was unmistakable.

My gaze drifted back to the delicate teacup sitting innocently on the table. It hummed with an almost imperceptible energy, a silent testament to the ancient power that had graced our humble kitchen. Could it be? After all these years… maybe… maybe ${user_name} is the one the prophecy spoke of. For Stellae Noctis, a being of such immense power, to directly intervene… it couldn't be a coincidence.

Carefully, I picked up the teacup, the weight surprisingly light in my hand. The steam still curled gently from its surface, carrying that faint, ethereal scent. I turned it slowly, examining every detail – the delicate floral pattern, the almost translucent quality of the material. There was no maker's mark, no inscription, nothing to indicate its origin. It simply *was*.

A thousand memories flickered through my mind – dusty tomes filled with forgotten lore, whispered tales around crackling fires, the legends of the ancient witches and their profound influence on the world. To think that one of them had directly intervened in ${user_name}'s life… it was both exhilarating and deeply unsettling. I should tell xdd about this. This is beyond anything I've encountered. Maybe one of xdd has more intel, more understanding of why Stellae Noctis has chosen to reveal herself in this way.

What did she want? What path had she set ${user_name} upon? And why now? So many questions swirled within me, unanswered and perhaps unanswerable. All I knew was that the world had shifted on its axis, and the life we knew was forever changed.

With a sigh, I placed the teacup back on the table, my gaze lingering on it for a moment longer. I would need to study this, to understand its significance. But for now, ${user_name} needed to learn to wield their newfound gift. And perhaps, just perhaps, a quiet afternoon by the river was the best way to start.

*page_break Fishing!

The path to the river was familiar, worn smooth by countless trips over the years. The air was fresh, carrying the scent of damp earth and the gentle murmur of flowing water grew louder with each step. Reaching the riverbank, I found my usual spot – a smooth, flat rock beneath the shade of an old willow tree. I unslung my fishing rod, the familiar weight comforting in my hands.

After some time, the initial excitement and confusion of the morning began to settle. The gentle rhythm of the river, the rustling leaves in the willow tree, the distant buzz of insects – it all created a sense of calm. My fishing rod lay beside me, untouched. My thoughts kept returning to the dream, to 'n', and to that incredible feeling of connection to the water. I knew ${grandparent} had sent me here to fish, but I couldn't shake the urge to explore this newfound ability.

Muttering to myself, I mustered some courage and readied myself to try out my newfound ability. It was still so foreign, so… subtle. I didn't expect to summon geysers or control the entire river. Just a tiny ripple, a small nudge… anything to confirm it wasn't just a fleeting moment in a dream. How could I use this to help me catch dinner?

*choice
    # I focused on the water around my bait, trying to subtly guide fish closer.
        I held my breath, staring intently at the spot where my bait would soon be. I focused all my will, imagining the water there becoming more inviting, sending out a subtle pull that would gently nudge any nearby fish in its direction. It was like trying to beckon with an invisible hand – a delicate, challenging task. I felt a faint resistance from the natural current, but also a subtle obedience in its flow.
        *goto fishing_attempt_result

    # I tried to sense the life beneath the surface, locating where the fish might be hiding.
        I closed my eyes, reaching out with my senses into the river's depths. I focused on the feeling of life within the water, the quick darting movements, the slower glides. It was like listening to a faint heartbeat beneath the surface. I could sense clusters of activity, areas where the fish seemed more concentrated, perhaps hiding amongst the rocks or beneath submerged logs. It wasn't a clear picture, more like a general sense of where life was thriving.
        *goto fishing_attempt_result

    # I focused on my bait, trying to imbue it with a magical allure that fish couldn't resist.
        I picked up a juicy worm, holding it between my fingers. I focused my will, imagining a faint energy, a subtle shimmer, radiating from the bait, making it irresistible to any fish nearby. It was a strange feeling, pushing this unseen force into a mundane object. The worm didn't glow or change, but for a moment, I felt a faint resonance, as if the water itself was acknowledging the attempt to make the bait more enticing.
        *goto fishing_attempt_result

    # I tried to create a subtle low-pressure zone in the water near my bait, a trick from fluid dynamics, but with magic.
        Remembering my physics classes, I focused on the principles of fluid dynamics. Could I use my water magic to create a tiny, subtle low-pressure zone in the water around my bait? In theory, this might draw fish in. I concentrated, pushing my will into the water, trying to manipulate pressure on a micro-level. I felt a faint instability in the water's flow, a subtle swirl that might have been my doing, or might have been natural. It was an intriguing blend of old knowledge and new power.
        *goto fishing_attempt_result

    # I sent a mental image of a giant, delicious worm out into the water, hoping the fish would get the telepathic hint.
        A giggle threatened to escape my lips. Could I communicate with fish? Probably not. But it was worth a try! I closed my eyes for a second and focused on sending a strong mental image into the river – a truly colossal, incredibly tasty-looking worm, wiggling enticingly. I imagined tiny fish brains receiving this absurd telepathic message. I opened my eyes, half-expecting a fish to leap out of the water in confusion. Nothing happened, of course, but the attempt itself was amusing.

The quiet patience of fishing settled over me once more, but this time, it was tinged with the exhilarating possibility of something more than just skill and luck. Minutes turned into what felt like an hour. The sun was higher in the sky now, the dappled light shifting on the water's surface. Just as I was starting to wonder if my efforts had been in vain, a definite tug on the line jolted me back to attention! It was a strong pull, the rod bending sharply. A fish!

*goto fish_on_struggle

*label fish_on_struggle

*page_break

The rod bent sharply under the weight of the unseen creature below, its line cutting through the water like a taut thread pulled by an invisible hand. My heart raced as adrenaline coursed through me. Was this the result of my newfound hydromancy? Or just dumb luck? Either way, there was no time to think—only act.

I tightened my grip on the rod, feeling the strength of whatever was fighting against me. It thrashed wildly beneath the surface, sending ripples cascading outward. For a moment, doubt crept in. What if I lost it? What if all my effort had been for nothing?

*choice
    # Trust in my new abilities. I focused on the water around the fish, trying to calm it or guide it closer.
        I closed my eyes briefly, drawing on that strange connection I'd felt earlier. The water wasn't just an element—it was alive, responsive. I reached out mentally, not commanding but coaxing, trying to soothe the frantic energy radiating from the fish. "Easy now," I whispered aloud, though it wasn’t meant for anyone—or anything—to hear. Slowly, the tension on the line eased, and I could feel the fish growing less resistant, almost as if it understood. 
        *goto reel_it_in

    # Play it safe and rely on traditional fishing techniques. Patience and steady pressure would win the day.
        I gritted my teeth and leaned back, letting the rod do the work. This wasn’t about magic; it was about skill. Every tug from the fish was met with careful resistance, every surge countered with calculated movements. Sweat beaded on my brow as I fought to keep control. The battle felt primal, ancient even—a contest between human ingenuity and nature’s raw power. But I refused to give up. Not after coming so far.
        *goto reel_it_in

    # Combine both approaches. Use my hydromancy to assist my technique.
        Why choose one when I could use both? I focused on maintaining steady pressure with the rod while simultaneously reaching out with my mind. The water responded faintly, swirling around the fish in gentle currents that seemed to nudge it toward me. It was exhausting, splitting my attention like this, but also exhilarating. Magic and muscle worked together in harmony, each complementing the other. I could feel the fish tiring, its struggles growing weaker.
        *goto reel_it_in

*label reel_it_in

With one final burst of effort, I reeled in the line, pulling the fish closer until it broke the surface with a splash. Its scales shimmered brilliantly in the sunlight, catching hues of gold and silver as it gasped for air. A surge of triumph washed over me. Whether it was thanks to skill, magic, or some combination of the two, I’d done it—I’d caught dinner.

But as I stared down at the wriggling creature, something unexpected stirred within me. Guilt? Gratitude? Respect? Fishing had always been practical, a means to survive, but now… now it felt different. 

"You're beautiful," I murmured, half to myself, half to the fish. Then, shaking off the sentimentality, I set to work preparing my prize. After all, ${grandparent} would be waiting, and tonight's meal promised to be unforgettable—not just because of the food, but because of how I’d earned it.

*goto return_to_village

*label return_to_village

The walk back to the village was quieter than the journey here, the sun dipping toward the horizon. The fish hung securely from my belt, its weight a small but satisfying reminder of what I’d accomplished. I brushed my fingers absently over its smooth scales, still marveling at how today had been… different.

As I neared the outskirts of town, the distant hum of activity reached me—voices chatting, tools clinking, laughter carried on the breeze. It was comforting, familiar, yet there was an undercurrent of purpose. Everyone seemed to belong somewhere, doing something useful.

For a moment, I hesitated. Should I head straight home or stop by the square? Someone might find my strange morning amusing—or laugh at me—but the thought of sharing it tugged at me. Stories mattered, even if they weren’t practical.

Still, tonight wasn’t the night for long conversations. $!{grandparent} would probably already have a small fire crackling outside, using sticks and dried leaves to get it going. $!{pronoun} always knew how to make do with what we had—simple tools, simple meals, but somehow they felt richer because of it. I imagined $!{objpronoun} sharpening a stick now, ready to skewer the fish and prop it over the flames. 

I couldn’t wait to see $!{pospronoun} face when I told $!{objpronoun} about the river—and maybe, just maybe, hint at the odd new feeling stirring inside me. For now, though, the promise of warmth, good food, and $!{pospronoun} gruff company was enough.

The walk back to the sanctuary was peaceful, filled with the warmth of familiarity. Villagers greeted me as I passed—little kids chasing each other around carts, their laughter ringing out like music; elders nodding from their porches, smiles creasing their weathered faces. It was one of those rare moments where everything felt… right. The world could be kind sometimes.

But then, something—or rather, someone—caught my attention.

Standing near the edge of the village square, partially obscured by the shadow of a large oak tree, was a figure who seemed utterly out of place. She was tall, commanding, her presence almost tangible even from a distance. Her wide-brimmed hat, pointed at the top like something out of legend, cast a dramatic silhouette against the afternoon sun. The hat was a deep red-maroon, its fabric shimmering faintly, as though it had been spun from twilight itself. Beneath it, her long robe flowed down to the ground, dark and heavy, embroidered with intricate golden patterns that seemed to shift lazily, like constellations moving across the night sky. Underneath the robe, hints of black clothing peeked through—a stark contrast to the vibrancy of her outer attire.

Her face was striking, sharp yet serene, framed by locks of raven-black hair streaked with silver strands that caught the light like threads of starlight. Her eyes... they were what truly held me captive. They glimmered with an unnatural hue, somewhere between molten gold and ember-red, ancient and knowing, as if they’d witnessed centuries unspool before them. And yet, despite her imposing appearance, there was a quiet grace about her, a stillness that made her seem untouchable, otherworldly.

What struck me most, though, was how no one else seemed to notice her. The villagers walked past her without so much as a glance, their cheerful chatter uninterrupted. It was as if she existed in a different plane altogether, visible only to me.
*label mysterious_woman_encounter

The path back to the village after the fishing trip felt different now. My hand still tingled with the faint presence of the mark, and ${grandparent}'s words about ancient witches and prophecies echoed in my mind. As I approached the village square, my gaze fell upon a woman standing near the ancient oak tree in the center.

She was unlike anyone I had seen before. Tall and elegant, she wore a wide-brimmed red-maroon hat that obscured her face in shadow, but beneath the brim, I caught the briefest glimpse of intensely golden eyes watching me. She seemed to radiate an aura of quiet power, a stillness that drew the eye amidst the usual hustle and bustle of the village. My heart skipped a beat. This felt… significant.

How do I react to this mysterious woman?

*choice
    # Casually tip an imaginary hat and wink.
        Despite the strange circumstances, a flicker of my more playful side emerged. Who was this mysterious figure? Perhaps a bit of levity was in order. I casually tipped an imaginary hat in her direction and offered a quick wink, a silent, slightly absurd greeting. Her golden eyes, visible just for a moment under the brim of her hat, seemed to glint with... amusement?

        Then, with a tiny gesture, she lifted a single, gloved finger almost imperceptibly, and the air around her shimmered for a split second, like heat rising from stone.

        The world around us *snapped*. The bustling village froze mid-motion: birds hung suspended in the air, silent as painted birds on a canvas; villagers stood still as statues, their laughter abruptly silenced. The vibrant sounds of life were replaced by a heavy, ringing silence that pressed against my ears, and the light seemed to flatten, losing its depth. The temperature dropped noticeably, a sudden, unnatural chill in the air, carrying a faint, strange scent like ozone after lightning.

        My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drum in the eerie quiet, but I couldn't vocalize a gasp. I felt incredibly exposed, as if her gaze saw not just me, but the very threads of my being.

        And yet, the woman in the red-maroon hat remained unchanged, standing tall and serene beneath its wide brim. Golden threads woven into her robe seemed to pulse faintly in the frozen moment, and a tiny, fleeting spark of orange light reflected in her eyes, a firefly caught in a golden gaze. Her expression remained calm, almost unreadable, but her lips curved into an enigmatic smile that sent shivers down my spine, a smile that held both immense power and knowing amusement.

        “Threads weave unseen,” she said softly, her voice smooth and resonant, cutting through the silence like a whisper carried on the wind, carrying a weight that felt older than time itself. “The vessel stirs. Aetherial currents guide you now.”

        My breath hitched, my mind struggling to process her impossible presence and cryptic words.

        Before I could ask what she meant, she continued, her smile unwavering, that spark in her eyes intensifying for just a fraction of a second. “Fire sleeps within you, restless and untamed. Its spark awaits your call.” She tilted her head slightly, as if studying me, her golden eyes piercing. “Will you answer?”

    # Quickly pick up a small pebble and flick it towards her hat.
        An inexplicable urge, a sudden burst of impulsiveness, overcame me. It was probably a terrible idea, but something about her stillness felt challenging. I quickly bent down, snatched up a small pebble from the path, and flicked it towards the brim of her hat. It bounced harmlessly off the felt. Her golden eyes, visible just for a moment under the brim, seemed to narrow slightly, not in anger, but… contemplation?

        Then, with a tiny gesture, she lifted a single, gloved finger almost imperceptibly, and the air around her shimmered for a split second, like heat rising from stone.

Golden threads woven into her robe seemed to pulse faintly in the frozen moment, and a tiny, fleeting spark of orange light reflected in her eyes, a firefly caught in a golden gaze. Her expression remained calm, almost unreadable, but her lips curved into an enigmatic smile that sent shivers down my spine, a smile that held both immense power and knowing amusement.

    # Approach her cautiously.
        Something about her compelled me forward, though every instinct screamed caution. Her red-maroon hat seemed to draw the light, her golden eyes holding an ancient depth. I took a step toward her, then another, until I stood just a few paces away. Up close, her presence was overwhelming—radiating power, wisdom, and something else I couldn’t quite name. It wasn’t oppressive; instead, it felt like the comforting warmth of sunlight on a cold day, carrying a faint, strange scent like ozone after lightning.

        As I reached out to speak, a tiny gesture. She lifted a single, gloved finger almost imperceptibly, and the air around her shimmered for a split second, like heat rising from stone.

    # Ignore her and continue walking.
        I hesitated, staring at her for a moment longer. Was she real? Or was my mind playing tricks after everything that had happened today? Shaking my head, I forced myself to look away and kept walking, the hairs on the back of my neck beginning to prickle. Whatever she was, whoever she was, I didn’t have time for distractions right now.

        Yet, as I moved farther from the square, I couldn’t shake the feeling that her gaze lingered on me, piercing through the crowd like a physical touch. By the time I reached the outskirts of the village, the feeling intensified to an uncomfortable degree. Turning slightly, I saw her again—only now, she was closer, standing silently beneath another tree, watching me with those unnerving golden eyes.

        Before I could react, a tiny gesture. She lifted a single, gloved finger almost imperceptibly, and the air around her shimmered for a split second, like heat rising from stone.

The world snapped back to normal, the sounds of the village rushing in like a tide. The woman was gone, leaving only the lingering warmth of her presence—and the echo of her cryptic words in my mind, a burning question hanging in the air.

Suddenly, a sharp, intense burning pain erupted in the palm of my hand, like a brand being pressed into my skin. I gasped, clutching my hand, my fingers instinctively curling inwards. The pain pulsed, hot and insistent.

Lowering my hand slowly, bracing myself, I looked at my palm. There, etched onto my skin, was a mark I'd never seen before. It wasn't raised or scarred, but more like an intricate tattoo of swirling lines and symbols. As I watched, it began to glow with a soft, ethereal blue light, pulsing faintly, then fading back to a subtle outline, only to glow again moments later. On. Off. On. Off. The burning pain subsided slightly with each pulse, but the sensation of the mark remained, a constant, undeniable presence.

How did I react to this sudden pain and the strange glowing mark?

    # I gritted my teeth against the pain and studied the mark intently.
        Ignoring the searing pain, I forced myself to focus, studying the intricate design etched onto my palm. What were these symbols? What did they mean? This wasn't just a mark; it felt significant, a direct consequence of the encounter. The pain was a price; understanding was the goal.

    # What *is* this? I poked at the mark, trying to understand its nature.
        Pain aside, a powerful surge of curiosity overcame me. What was this mark? Was it magic? A message? I carefully poked at the glowing lines with a fingertip from my other hand. The sensation was strange – not quite solid, but not just an image either. It felt… connected.

        Fear, sharp and cold, pierced through the residual awe of the encounter. This hurt! And it was *glowing*!

My mind raced, trying to piece together the last few moments before the searing pain in my hand. I was walking through the village square, I remember that. But then... a blur. Something happened. Someone was there? A feeling, a presence... but no clear image, no sound. It was like a page had been ripped from my memory, leaving only a frustrating blank space. What exactly happened just now?

As that thought solidified, the vibrant colors of the village square began to warp and bleed, like paint running on a wet canvas. The ground beneath my feet dissolved into a swirling, formless grey. My stomach lurching, I felt myself falling, the sounds of the village fading into a distant whisper until only a profound, absolute silence remained. I was plunging into nothingness, suspended in a void of complete and utter darkness, the sensation of falling endless.

Just as the disorientation threatened to overwhelm me, a voice resonated around me, soft yet filling the emptiness, carrying an ancient resonance I hadn't heard before.

"Fear not the fall, child. The descent is often where truths are found. I am Ch. A chronicler of currents, a whisper in the grand design. You seek understanding, and the tapestries of time hold many answers you need. Some threads burn brighter than others, igniting the path forward." Her voice was cool, vague, and undeniably powerful, settling around me in the void, hinting at a power that could command heat itself, a force said in legends to be able to turn oceans to vapor. "Look now, upon the echoes of what was. A thread pulled from the great weave, for your eyes to see. Look upon the legacy of one who learned to dance with the flame, a student who surpassed even her master in the crucible of war."

As commanded, visions began to coalesce in the darkness before me, initiated by Ch's words. It wasn't a linear progression, but a chaotic cascade of images, rushing backwards then slowing, settling into a specific, terrifying period. Time itself seemed to stutter and reverse, buildings briefly reforming from rubble before collapsing again, burnt trees regaining leaves for a fleeting second before blackening and withering. This was the past. The Second Great War.

The scene solidified, and I was falling through a nightmare of devastation. Razed buildings stood like skeletal husks against a sky choked with fire and smoke. Fields were not green earth, but scorched black plains. Stone walls, once proud defenses, lay shattered in colossal heaps. Entire kingdoms felt... absent, wiped from the map, their civilizations lost to the relentless destruction and rampage of enemy forces. Fire and turmoil were everywhere, a symphony of destruction.

*page_break Symphony of Destruction..

And then, the sky above Aethelgard, the grand city, tore open. Not with clouds, but with fire. Giant fireballs, like meteors ripped from the heavens, rained down with terrifying speed, each one a harbinger of total annihilation. They hurtled towards the heart of the human civilization, their fiery trails scorching the already polluted air. Hope felt like a forgotten word.

But just as impact seemed inevitable, the colossal fireballs juddered to a halt, suspended impossibly in the air above the city, their fiery glow casting an eerie, frozen light on the destruction below. Confusion rippled through the enemy ranks – the dark mages on the ground, the monstrous figures of the Lord of Decay's forces. Their ultimate weapon, halted?

Below, the kingdom's forces – the knights, guards, and royal mages who had braced for impact – stared up at the frozen meteors, then at each other. A spark ignited in their eyes, a surge of adrenaline and renewed resolve. They weren't defeated yet! With roars of defiance, their morale restored, they surged forward, clashing anew with the bewildered enemy.

Then, from the very center of the chaos, amidst the frozen fireballs and the renewed battle below, a figure ascended, seemingly guided by Ch's unseen hand. A lady, clad in armor-like garments of a deep, glowing red, rose effortlessly into the air, bathed in a brilliant, shimmering light that seemed to push back the surrounding darkness and smoke. She floated with an unnatural grace, her form radiating power. Her eyes, even from this distance in the vision, seemed to hold a familiar depth, a spark that resonated deep within me, a recognition that transcended memory.

She raised a hand towards the suspended meteors, her movements fluid and precise. It wasn't a forceful blast, but something almost surgical. The massive fireballs didn't explode; they were parted, cleanly sliced into smaller, still fiery chunks. And then, with a sweep of her arm, she didn't simply disperse them – she redirected them. The fragmented meteors, still burning fiercely, were sent hurtling back, not at the city, but at the enemy forces below, crashing down upon their bewildered ranks with devastating effect. Hope surged through the kingdom's defenders like a tidal wave. It seemed, against all odds, that the tide of the raid was turning, victory within reach.

*gosub_scene utils replace "Ch" "<span style=\"color: red\">Ch</span>"

*page_break Hope

But the Lord of Decay was not so easily defeated. The blood-red sky above tore open further, and from the swirling maelstrom descended a monstrosity that dwarfed even the giant meteors. A dragon, colossal in scale, its body and wings seemingly forged from solid, roiling fire, descended with an ear-splitting roar. It was the size of five mountains, its fiery presence turning the very air around it into an inferno. The sky above Aethegard turned a deeper, more terrifying shade of dark red as more meteors, smaller but still deadly, began to rain down in its wake.

Yet, the lady in red, floating amidst the inferno she had momentarily quelled, did not waver. Her glowing form seemed to intensify. She raised both hands, and with a surge of power that felt palpable even in this vision, she conjured her own colossal being. A dragon of shimmering light and pure magical energy manifested beside her, vast and majestic, a stark contrast to the destructive fire-beast.

The two titanic figures roared, their roars shaking the very fabric of the vision. They clashed in the blood-red sky, a cataclysm of fire and light, while the forces of good and evil continued their desperate struggle on the ravaged ground below, unaware of the cosmic battle raging above them.

Witch Ch's voice echoed one last time, filling the void with a final, resonant message. "Remember my name, child. Ch. Just like the one who brought you into this world, may the light of pyro guide you in times of darkness, just like it guided her. Go now, blessed one. My mark is with you. Control it, and you will control pyro itself."

The vision fractured then, the images shattering like glass. The roars faded, the fire and smoke dissolved, and the falling sensation intensified. But this time, as the darkness rushed up to meet me, I could discern shapes below. A familiar landscape. The sanctuary.

With a final rush, I landed, not with a bone-jarring thud, but with a soft impact, sinking into something yielding and prickly. A haystack. I lay there for a moment, breathless, the visions still swirling in my mind, the scent of straw filling my nostrils.

And then, a voice, closer this time, filled with utter shock.

*page_break Swooosh!

"By the... By the spirits! ${user_name}?!"

I blinked, turning my head. Standing just a few feet away, $!{pospronoun} jaw practically on the ground, eyes wide with disbelief, was ${grandparent}. $!{pronoun} stared at me, sprawled in the haystack, as if I had just fallen from the sky itself. Which, in a way, I supposed I had.

The sky above us was painted in the warm, rich hues of sunset – oranges, pinks, and deep purples bleeding into the fading blue. The air had a soft, golden quality, the light mellowing as the day drew to a close. It was the perfect time for dinner.

But before either of us could fully process the absurdity of the situation, the sky above us decided to add another layer of confusion. With a sudden *splat*, something wet and cold hit my face. Then another. And another!

Looking up, I saw them – fish! Not just one, but a cascade of them, raining down from the colorful sunset sky, accompanied by a brief, inexplicable shower of water droplets that vanished as quickly as they appeared. One particularly enthusiastic fish seemed to have aimed right for me, its slick body delivering a surprising slap across my cheek before landing with a wet thud in the hay beside me.

They were fresh, glistening, looking like they'd just been pulled from the river moments ago. Fish for dinner, delivered straight from the heavens?

${grandparent}'s eyes, already wide with shock at my sudden appearance, seemed to bulge even further. $!{pronoun} looked from me, to the falling fish, to the now-empty, sunset-streaked sky, then back to me, $!{pospronoun} mouth opening and closing soundlessly like a landed trout. $!{pospronoun} confusion was palpable, a silent question hanging in the air: What in the blazes is going on?!

*gosub_scene utils replace "Ch" "<span style=\"color: red\">Ch</span>"

*page_break

"What in the blazes is going on?!" ${grandparent}'s voice, usually so steady, was laced with utter disbelief. $!{pronoun} looked from the scattered fish in the hay to the still-colorful sunset sky, $!{pospronoun} brow furrowed in confusion. Then, $!{pospronoun} gaze fell back on me, sprawled in the haystack.

$!{pronoun} took a hesitant step forward, $!{pospronoun} practical nature seemingly overriding $!{pospronoun} shock. "Well, I'll be... fish? Raining fish? At least dinner's sorted, I suppose, but how in the seven hells..." $!{pronoun} started to bend down, perhaps to pick up one of the glistening catches.

But just as $!{pronoun} did, a searing heat erupted in my palm. The mark left by the woman flared, intensely bright, pulsing with a vibrant blue light that illuminated the surrounding hay. The sudden pain made me gasp, clutching my hand instinctively.

${grandparent} froze, $!{pospronoun} eyes snapping from the fish to my hand. $!{pospronoun} jaw, which had just begun to close, dropped open again. The bewildered look was replaced by one of profound alarm and astonishment. $!{pronoun} stared at the glowing mark, then at my face, a silent question, more urgent than the last, etched across $!{pospronoun} features.

What did I do in this moment, with ${grandparent} staring at the glowing mark on my hand?

*choice
    # Hide my hand quickly.
        My first instinct was to conceal the glowing mark, to shove my hand out of sight.

        *goto after_mark_flare_reaction

    # Stare at the glowing mark in awe.
        Despite the pain, the sight of the mark pulsing with light was mesmerizing. I could only stare at it.

        *goto after_mark_flare_reaction

    # Look from the mark to ${grandparent}, my eyes wide with confusion.
        I met ${grandparent}'s stunned gaze, my own eyes reflecting the confusion and fear I felt about the glowing mark.

        *goto after_mark_flare_reaction

    # Try to make the mark stop glowing.
        I focused my will, attempting to command the mark, to make the burning light subside.

        *goto after_mark_flare_reaction

*label after_mark_flare_reaction

${grandparent}'s eyes were locked onto the pulsing blue light on my palm, $!{pospronoun} face paling dramatically, the color draining away as if $!{pronoun}'d seen a ghost. The initial shock at my sudden appearance and the raining fish seemed to vanish completely now, replaced by a profound, almost bone-deep recognition and fear. $!{pospronoun} hand, which had been reaching instinctively for a fish, trembled violently, the sudden tremor running through $!{pospronoun} entire frame.

"By the... By the blazing hearth... I know that mark," ${grandparent} whispered again, $!{pospronoun} voice barely a breath, raspy with a mixture of astonishment, dread, and a dawning, terrible certainty. $!{pospronoun} gaze, usually warm and familiar, was now sharp, ancient, piercing, as if looking through me to something far older and more significant. This wasn't just a strange symbol; it was something from the hushed whispers of court mages, from encrypted imperial scrolls, from the kind of forbidden lore that only those privy to the deepest, most dangerous secrets would ever encounter. It was a mark of immense power, rarely, if ever , truly seen by mortal eyes.

$!{pronoun} stumbled back another step, $!{pospronoun} eyes wide, fixed on the glowing symbol on my hand as if it might vanish if $!{pronoun} looked away. A wave of memories, potent and heartbreaking, seemed to wash over $!{objpronoun}, $!{pospronoun} expression shifting from pure awe to a sudden, painful realization. "You're... you're just like..." $!{pronoun} trailed off, $!{pospronoun} voice catching in $!{pospronoun} throat, thick with emotion. $!{pospronoun} gaze softened, finding my eyes, filled with a painful familiarity, a dawning sorrow, and an undeniable truth. "...just like your mother."

*choice
    # My mother? Are you sure?
        That couldn't be right. My mother? The woman in my fragmented memories, the one ${grandparent} rarely spoke of... she had a mark like this? The disbelief was immediate and strong.
        
        *goto grandpa_book_reaction

    # She had this mark? Tell me about it!
        A sudden, intense need for answers about my mother surged through me. This mark, this magic, was connected to her. I needed to know everything ${grandparent} knew.
        
        *goto grandpa_book_reaction

    # This power... it came from her?
        The glowing on my hand suddenly felt different. Not just my own awakening, but a legacy. Was this power something I inherited? Something she passed down?
        
        *goto grandpa_book_reaction

*label grandpa_book_reaction

Your mother’s mark… the Corona Ignis , $!{pronoun} finally said, $!{pospronoun} voice low, barely more than breath against the weight of history pressing down on us. The Crown of Fire. A brand of blazing legend, carved not by mortal hands but by the raw force of flame itself. It was tied to destruction and creation alike — wielded in war, feared in peace. Bound to the purest, most terrifying expression of fire magic ever recorded.

$!{pronoun} whispered its name like it still carried heat, like speaking it too loudly might reignite the battles it once fueled. It had been borne by only a handful — those who stood at the edge of the world and defied its collapse. Wielders spoken of in secret tongues, their stories buried beneath imperial decrees and forbidden scrolls. They were the Marked Ones — warriors from lands unknown, summoned in the Second Great War to stand against Azgorthos, the Lord of Decay $!{reflexive}.

For centuries, scholars called it fiction. Clerics warned of its corruption. Kings erased all mention. And yet... it was real.
And your mother bore it.

${grandparent}’s eyes flickered back to my hand as the glow pulsed again — blue now, then green, then red, shifting like a living thing. Not fire alone. Not water or wind. But something else entirely. Something deeper. $!{pospronoun} lips parted, trembling as if struggling to shape words that hadn't been spoken in lifetimes.

“…But yours .”

*page_break ...

$!{pospronoun} voice cracked with wonder, thick with disbelief. “The Dominium Elementa,” $!{pronoun} breathed, the syllables shaped with reverence. The Dominion of Elements. A name never written in any prophecy, never etched into surviving records. A myth among myths — an impossibility wrapped in legend. Said to be a mark of control over all elements , not by force or study, but by will alone.

$!{pronoun} stared at the book, then at me, then at the glowing palm that should not exist. “Never seen,” $!{pronoun} murmured, almost dazed. “Never recorded. Never even dared to imagine.” $!{pronoun} swallowed hard, $!{pospronoun} voice breaking under the gravity of what $!{pronoun} was about to say.

“Until now.”

The finality of it hung in the air like thunder before the storm. Outside, the wind hushed. Even the hearthfire seemed to dim. All that remained was the light from my skin — and the old man across from me, clutching a truth so dangerous it could shake empires.

“You…” $!{pronoun} said, staring at me like I was both miracle and catastrophe rolled into one. “You bear a power that history has never witnessed.”

*comment maybe question loop here?

*label askGrampsLoop1

The weight of $!{pospronoun} words settled upon me, heavy and undeniable. My palm throbbed with the pulsing, shifting light of the Dominium Elementa. So many questions swam in my head, each one more staggering than the last. What did I ask $!{objpronoun}?

*choice
    # Tell me about the prophecy you mentioned.

        ${grandparent} nodded slowly, $!{pospronoun} gaze falling to the worn book still open in $!{pospronoun} hands. "The prophecy..." $!{pronoun} murmured, $!{pospronoun} voice tinged with a deep solemnity. "It's more than just an old tale, ${user_name}. It's a map, a warning, and perhaps... a glimpse of destiny."

        $!{pronoun} carefully adjusted $!{pospronoun} spectacles, $!{pospronoun} finger tracing the brittle pages until $!{pronoun} found the right section. "It's called 'The Prophecy of the Sleepless One'," $!{pronoun} said, looking up at me for a moment before beginning to read, $!{pospronoun} voice low but clear, carrying the weight of ages:

        ${grandparent} cleared $!{pospronoun} throat, $!{pospronoun} gaze fixed on the text.

        "In ages past, when stars did wane,
        And seven kings fell, dust and flame,
        A spell was cast, the world undone,
        A call unanswered—save for one."

        $!{pronoun} paused, looking up. "This speaks of the First Great War, a time of unimaginable destruction, worse even than the one you glimpsed. A world on the brink." $!{pronoun} returned to the book.

        "A child of silence, cold and pale,
        Breath withheld, yet never frail.
        Not dead, not gone, yet bound in fate,
        A hollow frame, in dreamlike state."

        $!{pospronoun} voice trembled slightly as $!{pronoun} read those lines, $!{pospronoun} eyes meeting mine, a clear implication hanging in the air.

        "$!{pospronoun} stillness mirrored, time stood bound,
        A vessel touched by cosmic will.
        Caged in slumber, locked in shade,
        A nameless soul, a choice unmade."

        $!{pronoun} paused again, a heavy sigh escaping $!{objpronoun}. "This part... this is the heart of the mystery, isn't it? The Sleepless One. A being held in suspension."

        "Yet when the heavens split asunder,
        When echoes break the sleeping thunder,
        A stranger walks from worlds unseen,
        With chains undone, by destiny sown."

        ${grandparent}'s finger tapped the page where it mentioned 'a stranger walks from worlds unseen'. "Could this be you, ${user_name}? From another world, arriving here at a pivotal moment?"

        "A Descender, marked by fate untold,
        Who bends the fire, and stills the cold.
        A master not of one, but all,
        Whose power shapes both rise and fall."

        $!{pospronoun} gaze snapped from the book to the glowing, color-shifting mark on my palm. "The Descender... marked by fate... and a master not of one, but all." $!{pospronoun} voice was thick with awe and certainty.

        "The sleeper waits, the stars align,
        The outland soul, the ancient sign.
        The worthy hand, the unseen guide,
        Shall wake the husk, the cage unbind."

        $!{pronoun} looked back at the book, then around at our surroundings, the quiet sanctuary, the setting sun. "The pieces aligning... your arrival... this mark... it's all part of a larger design."

        "And when the skies in crimson weep,
        When time’s own hands no longer keep,
        The one forgotten shall arise,
        With borrowed breath, with stolen eyes."

        ${grandparent}'s voice grew somber, a hint of dread returning. "Crimson skies... time unbound... This speaks of the end times, when the prophecy reaches its climax. The one forgotten... the Sleeper..."

        "To wield the storm, the quake, the tide,
        To cast the flame, the earth divide.
        A force unbroken, a fate unswayed,
        A kingdom lost, a debt repaid."

        $!{pronoun} finished reading, $!{pospronoun} voice resonating with the power of the ancient words. $!{pronoun} closed the book gently, though $!{pospronoun} hand still trembled slightly. $!{pronoun} looked at me, $!{pospronoun} eyes filled with a mixture of awe, hope, and profound concern.

        "For in the end, when war is nigh,
        And silence whispers through the sky,
        The Sleeper wakes, the world shall bend—
        And none shall halt what comes to end."

        *label after_prophecy_stranger

        "That, ${user_name}, is the prophecy," ${grandparent} said, $!{pospronoun} voice quiet now. "It speaks of immense power, of a fated awakening, and of a coming end that cannot be halted. It doesn't promise a hero or a savior... but it speaks of a force, the Sleeper, tied to elemental mastery. And I believe, with every fiber of my being, that this Sleeper... is connected to you, and to that mark on your hand. Your arrival, your power... it's all foretold. You are central to what is coming."

        ${grandparent}'s expression softened, a wave of tenderness and sorrow passing over $!{pospronoun} features. "Your mother, ${user_name}... she was extraordinary." $!{pronoun} paused, choosing $!{pospronoun} words carefully. "She possessed a strength that was quiet, but unyielding. Fiercely loyal, deeply compassionate, yet with a steel forged in trials you cannot yet imagine. She was not just my daughter, but my student... and in many ways, she surpassed her teacher." $!{pronoun} looked at my hand. "That mark she bore, Corona Ignis, was a reflection of her spirit – a burning light against the darkness. She was part of a... a specialized group, tasked with protecting the heart of the empire from threats that couldn't be faced openly. They operated in the shadows, their successes unknown, their sacrifices unmourned by most. Her disappearance... it left a wound that has never truly healed. 
        
        There's so much more to her story than I can tell you in a single breath."

                "She had your eyes, you know," ${grandparent} said softly, a faint smile touching $!{pospronoun} lips. "And a stubborn streak a mile wide when she believed in something. But she was also incredibly kind, always putting others before herself. She found beauty in the smallest things and could make you laugh even when you felt like weeping. She carried the weight of her duties with grace, but there was a lightness to her spirit, a joy that even the shadows couldn't fully extinguish. She taught me as much about life as I ever taught her about magic."
                *goto yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
            # Tell me more about her work and what she did for the empire.
                ${grandparent}'s expression grew more serious. "The group she was part of... their work was vital, and highly secret. They were the unseen shield of the empire, dealing with threats that operated in the shadows – cults, ancient artifacts, incursions from places best left undisturbed. They weren't knights who charged on battlefields; they were the ones who stopped the rot before it could spread. Your mother's skills, amplified by the Corona Ignis, made her invaluable. Their missions were dangerous, the stakes always impossibly high."
                *goto yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
            # Tell me more about the Corona Ignis mark itself.
                "The Corona Ignis," ${grandparent} murmured, $!{pospronoun} voice filled with respect. "The Crown of Fire. It grants unparalleled command over flame, allowing the wielder to conjure, shape, and control fire with a mastery few pyromancers could ever hope to achieve. But it's more than just power over fire; it's a mark of fierce protection, of a burning will to defend. It flares brightest when the wielder is defending what they cherish most. It was a symbol of hope and terror during the war – hope for us, terror for Azgorthos's forces. Its rarity, its power... it's why it became steeped in myth." $!{pronoun} hesitated, $!{pospronoun} gaze lowering, shadows passing over $!{pospronoun} features. "But power like that… it comes at a cost. Many who bore the Corona Ignis burned too brightly, too fast. Their own flames consumed them, leaving only ash where legends might have stood. Few lived long enough to master it, and fewer still to grow old with it." ${grandparent}’s voice softened, tinged with both grief and awe. "That is why your mother was unlike any other. She carried the blaze, not for days or months, but for years. She bent it to her will without letting it devour her. Strength like that… endurance like that… it is what set her apart, what made her more than just a bearer of fire. It made her a miracle."

        ${grandparent} patted the worn cover of the tome clutched in $!{pospronoun} hand. "This old thing?" $!{pronoun} chuckled, a dry, tired sound. "This is a repository of forgotten knowledge, ${user_name}. A lineage book, in a way, passed down through... well, through those who deemed it necessary to keep certain truths from fading into dust. It contains lore about ancient powers, about prophecies, about individuals who shaped history from the shadows. Information too dangerous or too unbelievable for common texts. It's where the knowledge of marks like the Corona Ignis and... and your Dominium Elementa... is painstakingly recorded, or in your mark's case, just hypothesized about. It took me years to even find it, and more years to decipher its most cryptic passages."

        *label abbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
        
        I recounted the impossible encounter in the square – the frozen time, the woman in the red hat, her golden eyes, the scent of ozone, her cryptic words, the sudden pain and the mark. Then, I described the terrifying, vivid vision – the falling, the void, Ch's voice introducing herself and her role, the descent into the war, the devastation, the meteors, the lady in red, the fire dragon, her dragon of light, their colossal clash. I told $!{objpronoun} about Ch's final message, mentioning her name, my mother, the pyro connection, and the mark. As I spoke, ${grandparent}'s face, already pale, seemed to lose even more color. $!{pospronoun} eyes widened, $!{pospronoun} jaw slackened, and $!{pronoun} gripped the book tightly. $!{pronoun} listened intently, sometimes interrupting with a hushed "By the spirits..." or "Impossible..."

        *choice
            # React to $!{pospronoun} shock at hearing "Ch".
                "Ch," ${grandparent} breathed, the name itself seeming to carry a weight I hadn't fully grasped. $!{pronoun} closed $!{pospronoun} eyes for a moment, a look of profound awe and disbelief on $!{pospronoun} face. "Witch Ch... The Chronicler. One of the ancient ones, a guardian of the timelines... and associated with pyro to a degree that defies comprehension. For her to appear to *you*... to speak to you... and for her to narrate that vision..." $!{pronoun} opened $!{pospronoun} eyes, $!{pospronoun} gaze filled with reverence and a touch of fear. "Her power... it's legendary beyond measure. Her interest in you... it confirms just how significant this is, ${user_name}."

            # React to $!{pospronoun} reaction to the vision content (war, dragons, Azgorthos).
                ${grandparent}'s face, already pale, grew even more ashen as I described the horrors you witnessed. $!{pronoun} didn't just listen; $!{pospronoun} eyes seemed to look past me, back through the years, $!{pospronoun} body tensing as if reliving the distant echoes of that time. "Azgorthos," $!{pronoun} muttered, the name a dark, heavy stone in $!{pospronoun} mouth. "The Lord of Decay. A true abomination."

                $!{pronoun} shivered, a deep tremor that wasn't from the evening chill. "We were miles away," $!{pronoun} said, $!{pospronoun} voice hoarse, a fragmented memory surfacing. "Pushing back a flanking force near the Black Peaks. But we could feel it... the *wrongness* in the air. The sky turned that sickening, blood-red color, even from that distance. The ground beneath our feet... it *trembled*, not from our own battle, but from impacts so far away they should have been silent. We saw the smoke... felt the heat on the wind... smelled the char and the decay riding on the currents. We knew something... something colossal was happening near Aethelgard. Something that bent the very world."

                $!{pronoun} looked back at me, $!{pospronoun} eyes wide with a terrible awe as $!{pronoun} processed the details I had described. "But to see *that* battle... through your eyes..." $!{pronoun} shook $!{pospronoun} head, still processing the immensity. "The meteors, halted by... by *your mother*." $!{pronoun} said the last words with a profound certainty, $!{pospronoun} voice filled with a mixture of heartbreak and pride. "It was her. In her red armor... it had to be." $!{pronoun} looked at my hand, the shifting mark pulsing, then back at me. "And then... *$!{pospronoun}* dragon. The Flame Tyrant. We saw a shadow, a shape against the poisoned sky, so vast it blotted out the sun, but... but I never imagined..." $!{pospronoun} voice trailed off, words failing $!{objpronoun} in the face of the vision's reality. "And her response... a dragon of light? Facing down solid fire?" $!{pronoun} looked at my hand again. "The clash of those titans... *your mother* facing down a mountain of fire with sheer power and light... That wasn't just a battle, ${user_name}$. That was a pivotal moment, a turning point etched not just in history books, but in the very magical history of this world. To have seen it... to have truly *seen* her..." The weight of the vision settled between us, a shared burden of ancient power, sacrifice, and a mother's legacy.

                ${grandparent}'s gaze returned to my hand, the color-shifting mark pulsing with its mesmerizing display. $!{pronoun} repeated Ch's words about pyro, my mother, and controlling the mark, a thoughtful frown on $!{pospronoun} face. "She speaks of pyro... 'the light of pyro guide you,' she said, tied to your mother who bore the Corona Ignis... when your first demonstrated ability, only hours ago, was hydromancy. And yet," $!{pronoun} looked at the mark, "the Dominium Elementa, as the book explains, is the command over *all* elements, not just one." $!{pronoun} tapped the space above the mark lightly with a trembling finger, though $!{pronoun} didn't touch it directly.

                "Perhaps," $!{pronoun} mused, the puzzle pieces clicking into place in $!{pospronoun} mind, "Witch Ch, herself a master of pyro, and your mother's teacher, sees the element of fire as the next affinity you need to awaken within the mark. Or perhaps it's a fundamental key to understanding the mark's full potential. The Dominium Elementa gives you the *capacity* for all elements, ${user_name}, but it seems you must actively unlock and control each one. And given your mother's lineage, and Ch's own power... it makes a strange sort of sense that fire would be a crucial step for you. Not the *core* power of the mark itself, which is the dominion over all, but perhaps the next 'door' you must open to truly wield it. Just like she did." $!{pronoun} looked at me, a challenge in $!{pospronoun} eyes. "It seems the Chronicler has given you your next lesson."

"The Obsidian Covenant," $!{pronoun} finally murmured, $!{pospronoun} voice low and grim. "They are the architects of ruin, $!{gramps_name}.

                ${grandparent} looked at my mark, then back at my face. "They are disciples of nothingness," $!{pronoun} said, the words tasting like ash.

                "Their vision is a world stripped bare. Where vitality withers, where truth is irrelevant, and where order dissolves into a chaos dictated by The Opposer, the force they truly serve. Azgorthos, the Lord of Decay, is their key – the ultimate agent of entropy needed to clear away the old world and usher in their dark ideal.

                "All of that, and worse," ${grandparent} confirmed, a bitter edge to $!{pospronoun} tone. "They are powerful individuals, drawn from every corner of the Seven Nations – corrupt nobles, ruthless scholars of forbidden magic, disillusioned warriors, merchants who trade in despair. They consolidated after the war, finding common cause in their nihilism and lust for power."

                "They don't wear uniforms or march openly. They operate from gilded cages and forgotten crypts, weaving their influence through society like a poison. They are the hidden hands behind events, bound by ambition and a terrifying faith in their dark patrons. You could walk past one in the market and never know the darkness they carry."

                "The assassination attempt was central, their precise strike against a king. It was meant to plunge the world into chaos, a planned collapse that would weaken the nations and pave the way for their rise and Azgorthos's return. But it wasn't just that."
            
                "They manipulated events, funded conflicts, spread discord. They fanned the flames of hatred between nations, like Aethelgard and Drakkar. The war was their crucible, meant to break the world's will and leave it ripe for their taking. The cataclysm... while not directly caused by their assassination plot, it was a consequence of the chaos they unleashed, a wound they now seek to exploit."

                "They have eyes everywhere – spies, informants, corrupted officials, perhaps even dark magic that can sense echoes of prophecy or powerful sigils like yours."
            
                "Your mark," $!{pronoun} looked at my hand, "it's a beacon to those who understand such things, both light and dark.

                $!{grandparent}' expression was solemn. "It is a pact, a devotion, a terrible symbiosis. They don't just worship from afar. They seek communion, channeling the forces of Decay and Chaos, preparing the world for their patrons' return."
            
                "They may perform dark rituals, seek artifacts imbued with their power, twist reality in their image.

        $!{grandparent} nodded, $!{pospronoun} expression thoughtful. "It is different. Profoundly so. Elemental magic, for most, is a singular attunement, honed over years. Your mark... it bypasses those limits. You command not one, but potentially all the Primal elements, instinctively. That isn't taught in any academy."
    
        "Your mother's mastery of fire was immense, tied to her own mark, but even she focused on one element in that way."
    
        "Training will be unlike anything in the old texts. It will be about understanding the mark and learning to wield forces that few mortals have ever touched, let alone controlled. It will be dangerous, ${user_name}, and you'll need to forge your own path, guided by the knowledge we uncover."

        ${grandparent}'s jaw tightened. "Azgorthos is not merely a demon or a warlord, $!{gramps_name}. $!{pronoun} is an ancient, cosmic entity, the embodiment of Decay itself. A force meant to unravel existence, tied to the ultimate Chaos of The Opposer."
    
        "In the First Great War, thousands of years ago, $!{pronoun} sought to consume this reality. It took the combined strength and sacrifice of the Seven Paragons, heroes from each unified nation, to defeat $!{objpronoun}. They paid a terrible price, vanishing or giving their lives, but they banished $!{objpronoun}."
    
        "$!{pronoun} was defeated, but never destroyed. $!{pospronoun} essence lingered, leaving behind powerful artifacts imbued with decay and spawning dangerous 'offsprings' like the Abyssal Maw.

        ${grandparent} nodded slowly. "The mark is ancient, ${user_name}, tied to lineages and cycles of destiny. Your mother was the most recent, the most powerful 'Marked One' in centuries, a master of fire unmatched in her time."
    
        "The book... it holds records, fragments of lore about others who bore powerful sigils. Individuals tied to great power and often, tragic fates. They were rare, their abilities often tied to a single, dominant element like your mother's fire. The prophecy speaks of a mastery of *all*, which makes your mark... and you... something unique, even among the legends."
    
        "Most stories of the 'Marked Ones' recorded in that tome... they end abruptly. As the book says, 'none of them lived long enough to tell their story.' It is a legacy of great power, but also great peril."

    # I think... I need some time to process all of this.
        "Understandable, child," ${grandparent} said softly, the intensity in $!{pospronoun} eyes easing slightly. $!{pronoun} gently closed the ancient book, though $!{pronoun} kept $!{pospronoun} hand resting on its cover. "This is... a lot to take in. For both of us. Mysteries centuries old, powers thought impossible, connections to a past shrouded in darkness and sacrifice." $!{pronoun} looked at the color-shifting mark on my hand, then offered a tired but genuine smile. "We have time. For now, let's... let's just sit with this for a moment."

The questions I had asked, and the answers ${grandparent} had given, swirled in my mind. Prophecy, ancient marks, my mother's hidden life, ${grandparent}'s shadowed past in the Obsidian Covenant, the looming threat of Azgorthos, other marked individuals across the world... It was an overwhelming torrent of information, rewriting everything I thought I knew about myself and the world around me.

My palm still throbbed, the Dominium Elementa pulsing with its changing colors. The pain wasn't searing anymore, but it was a constant, insistent presence, a reminder of the impossible power now etched onto my skin.

${grandparent}'s gaze fell back to my hand, a look of concern on $!{pospronoun} face. "That mark... it still bothers you, doesn't it?" $!{pronoun} seemed to ponder for a moment, then $!{pospronoun} eyes lit up with a sudden idea. "Witch Ch mentioned pyro... and your mother's mark is tied to fire. Perhaps... perhaps the pain isn't just the mark settling, but energy wanting to be released. You have an affinity for *all* elements now, ${user_name}, not just water." $!{pronoun} looked at me, $!{pospronoun} voice firm but gentle. "Maybe you need to 'let it out,' as she suggested. Try... try using the light of pyro. Focus on the fire within the mark, within yourself." $!{pronoun} gestured towards the unlit hearth nearby. "The hearth is ready. See if you can coax a flame."

"Alright, ${gramps_name}," ${grandparent} said, ${pospronoun} voice soft but firm, gesturing towards the unlit hearth. "Let's start simple. Just a spark."

What did you do?

*choice
    # Channel the power directly.
        You took a breath and held your hand out. A low, powerful thrumming erupted from your palm, a sound that made the ground tremble. The kindling in the hearth didn't ignite; it simply shattered in a small, contained burst, leaving behind a faint smell of burnt wood and a scorching hole in the earth.
        *goto after_failure

    # Visualize a flame.
        You closed your eyes, picturing a tiny, perfect flame dancing on the kindling. Your magic responded instantly, but with a sudden, uncontrolled surge. The mental image became a physical reality for a brief moment, then burst in a small, contained explosion, leaving behind a faint smell of burnt wood and a scorching hole in the earth.
        *goto after_failure

    # Let your instincts guide you.
        You didn't think, you simply acted. You let the raw, pulsing energy from your mark flow without direction, hoping it would know what to do. It responded with a chaotic roar, and the kindling in the hearth simply shattered in a small, contained burst, leaving behind a faint smell of burnt wood and a scorching hole in the earth.

${grandparent}'s eyes were wide. ${pronoun} didn't laugh this time. "Looks like the raw power doesn't appreciate being commanded with a wish," ${pronoun} said, ${pospronoun} voice now low and serious, a familiar look of concern returning to ${pospronoun} features. "You have to learn to channel it. Stop trying to force it." ${pronoun} placed a hand on your shoulder. "Think about what it feels like. Think about her… about warmth. The light of pyro is tied to your mother's will, remember."

[i] Then, a voice that was not your own echoed in the hollows of your mind. It was a single word, as clear as a bell, a presence that settled into the core of your thoughts.

[i] Focus.[/i] 

What did you focus on?

    # My Mother's Strength: Her defiant dragon of light.
        You closed your eyes, letting the chaos of your mind quiet. You channeled the whispered word, Focus, and anchored your thoughts on the most powerful image of fire you'd witnessed: your mother's radiant dragon, a creature of fierce warmth and unwavering will. It was more than a memory—it was a tangible feeling, a deep resonance within the mark on your hand.
        *goto after_focus_choice

    # Pure, Unadulterated Warmth: The most comforting sensation.
        You closed your eyes, letting the chaos of your mind quiet.

It was more than a memory—it was a tangible feeling, a deep resonance within the mark on your hand.
        *goto after_focus_choice

    # The Essence of Pyro: Its raw, guiding force.
        You closed your eyes, letting the chaos of your mind quiet. The internal Focus sharpened your intent. You reached for the raw concept of "light of pyro," not just fire, but its essence as a primal, guiding force, just as Witch Ch described. It was more than a memory—it was a tangible feeling, a deep resonance within the mark on your hand.

    # The Practical Solution: Rub two sticks together.
        You shook your head, flustered and overwhelmed. A voice in your head? Cosmic powers? This was all too much. You grabbed two stray sticks from the ground and began to rub them together furiously, the way ${grandparent} had taught you when you were a child. "There," you muttered. "That's how you make fire." The kindling refused to even smoke.

        ${grandparent} let out a short, tired chuckle and shook ${pospronoun} head. "${gramps_name}, I think we're well past kindling a fire with elbow grease," ${pronoun} said, ${pospronoun} voice laced with dry amusement.

        You threw the sticks down in exasperation, and it was in that moment of defeat, of letting go of the struggle, that you felt a strange sensation in your hand. The whispered Focus echoed once more.

When you opened your eyes, a brilliant orb of fire hovered above the hearth—pure, blinding, and impossibly silent. Its heat pressed down like a living thing, beautiful yet terrifying in its hunger.

${grandparent} staggered back, ${pospronoun} eyes wide with reverence and fear.
"By the blazing hearth…" ${pronoun} whispered, voice trembling. "That’s no wish, ${gramps_name}… that’s a miracle."

For a heartbeat, ${grandparent} looked less like a guide and more like a child gazing at creation itself. A laugh—half wonder, half dread—slipped from ${pospronoun} lips. "No one calls fire without years of shaping. And yet you…" ${pronoun} faltered. "That’s not talent, that’s… Descen—"

The word died. The silence after it was heavier than the flame’s heat. ${grandparent} cleared ${pospronoun} throat, eyes hardening.
"But hear me, ${gramps_name}—this flame is not yours to command. Not yet. Until you learn to hold it steady, it will burn more than wood. It will burn everything."

The white blaze softened into a steady orange flame, crackling gently on the kindling. You sagged, breath shaky, your arm falling to your side.

${grandparent} drew in a long breath, awe still threaded through ${pospronoun} voice. "The first lesson is yours," ${pronoun} said quietly. "Power isn’t in the spark of its birth… but in the hand that tames it."

The last of the blinding light gave way to the gentle, rhythmic flicker of the hearth fire. The air, which had so recently reeked of ozone and burnt wood, now held the soothing scent of pine and the clean scent of fresh fish, a smell of the seven seas. The stars had begun to pepper the deepening twilight sky above.

"Alright, ${gramps_name}," ${grandparent} said, ${pospronoun} voice a familiar, calm sound. ${pronoun} handed you a small wooden skewer and a sharpened flint knife. "I'll clean. You skewer. It's an easy task, but mind you don't skewer your thumb. You've been through enough excitement for one day."

You took the knife, the cool stone a welcome contrast to the still-warm skin of your palm. The fish were an absurd sight, glistening and strangely perfect in the firelight. You began to clean one, focusing on the simple, repetitive motion of the blade against the scales, trying to anchor yourself in the mundane.

Once it was cleaned, you slid it onto the skewer, just as ${grandparent} had shown you. A small, simple bag caught your eye. It lay half-hidden by a stone near the hearth, and a quick glance inside revealed a small, organized collection of pouches, filled with different seasonings.

"We have to make sure it tastes as good as it looks," ${grandparent} said, as if reading your mind. ${pronoun} gestured to the pouches.

What would you add to your fish?

${grandparent} gestured to the glowing embers in the hearth. "Now, hold it steady. Not too close, mind. Fire is a partner, not a servant. It doesn't like to be told what to do."

You held the skewer out, but the moment you focused, a jolt of energy shot through your arm. The flawless cone of fire you'd just created seemed to remember its earlier, untamed nature. A jet of flame shot up from the hearth, briefly licking at your fish. The heat was immense, a tangible force that made the air feel like a furnace. The scent of cooking fish was replaced by a pungent smell of instant char.

${grandparent} let out a short, tired chuckle, shaking ${pospronoun} head."${gramps_name}, I think we're well past kindling a fire with elbow grease," ${pronoun} said, ${pospronoun} voice laced with dry amusement. "And apparently past cooking a meal with anything short of a solar flare."

You pulled the skewer back, a single, perfectly blackened fish on the end. It was so thoroughly cooked it resembled a lump of charcoal. A small, breathless laugh escaped you. The absurdity of it all finally hit you, and for a moment, the cosmic pressure in your chest was just a funny memory.

You managed to cook your second fish a bit more successfully, holding the skewer back from the embers.

*comment SHORT WAY TO COOK FISH

The last of the blinding light gave way to the gentle, rhythmic flicker of the hearth fire. The air, which had so recently reeked of ozone and burnt wood, now held the soothing scent of pine and the clean scent of fresh fish, a smell of the seven seas. The stars had begun to pepper the deepening twilight sky above.

"Alright, ${gramps_name}," ${grandparent} said, ${pospronoun} voice a familiar, calm sound. ${pronoun} handed you a small wooden skewer and a sharpened flint knife. "I'll clean. You skewer. It's an easy task, but mind you don't skewer your thumb. You've been through enough excitement for one day."

You took the knife, the cool stone a welcome contrast to the still-warm skin of your palm. The fish were an absurd sight, glistening and strangely perfect in the firelight. You began to clean one, focusing on the simple, repetitive motion of the blade against the scales, trying to anchor yourself in the mundane.

Once it was cleaned, you slid it onto the skewer, just as ${grandparent} had shown you. ${pronoun} gestured to the glowing embers in the hearth. "Now, hold it steady. Not too close, mind. Fire is a partner, not a servant. It doesn't like to be told what to do."

A moment of pure irony, you thought.

You held the skewer out, but the moment you focused, a jolt of energy shot through your arm. The flawless cone of fire you'd just created seemed to remember its earlier, untamed nature. A jet of flame shot up from the hearth, briefly licking at your fish. The heat was immense, a tangible force that made the air feel like a furnace.

You managed to cook your second fish a bit more successfully, holding the skewer back from the embers. The two of you ate in comfortable silence, the taste of the slightly-burnt but still delicious fish a far better comfort than the questions that loomed. As the last piece of fish was gone, and the fire settled into a gentle crackle, you felt a quiet sense of peace.

"That's enough excitement for one night," ${grandparent} said, breaking the silence. ${pospronoun} eyes were fixed on the embers. "Power is not about a grand beginning, but about a controlled end. You've done well for a first lesson. Now rest. We have much to learn tomorrow."

I caught the fish, and as I looked at it in my hands, something inside me stirred. My magic felt… stronger. The water element within me was no longer just an abstract idea—it was tangible, pressing against the edges of my consciousness. I could feel the flow of it, like a gentle current running through my veins, a quiet pull, but one that was beginning to feel more natural, more aligned with my movements.

${grandparent} patted me on the back with a proud grin. "Looks like you're starting to get the hang of this magic stuff. Not bad for a beginner."

I opened my mouth to reply when it happened.

A voice—soft, distant, yet impossibly clear—echoed faintly in my mind.

[i]"Chosen."[/i]

The word was weightless yet heavy, as if the very air had shifted to carry its meaning. My breath caught in my throat, and the fish slipped from my hands, splashing back into the river with an unexpected splash.

I froze, blinking at the spot where the fish had been only moments ago. The world around me seemed to fade as the sensation of that word, Chosen, reverberated in the depths of my mind. The stillness of the river, the rustling of the leaves—it all became secondary to the eerie sensation of being called.

A sharp ache pulsed through my chest, as if my very soul had been pulled in two. The feeling was overwhelming, and I didn’t know what to make of it. Was it a message? Or a warning? Was it just my mind playing tricks on me after everything that had happened today?

${grandparent}’s voice cut through my disorientation. “You good, ${user_name}? You look like you saw a ghost.”

I shook my head, struggling to refocus. I couldn’t tell $!{objpronoun} about the voice. It was… too unreal, too foreign. Magic was already strange enough, but this—this was different. No one else could hear it. No one else could sense it. It was mine—and I didn’t know what to do with it.

“I’m fine,” I muttered, forcing a half-smile.

${grandparent} didn’t seem convinced but chose not to press the issue. Instead, $!{pronoun} gestured to the river with a wry grin. “You sure that fish didn’t knock something loose in your head? No shame in getting knocked out by a fish. Happens to the best of us.”

I laughed, the tension in my body easing just a little. But in the back of my mind, that word kept echoing. Chosen. Why me?

“${grandparent}… what is this?” I asked, feeling the weight of the question settle between us like a heavy storm cloud. My eyes flickered to my hands, still damp from the fish, but now tingling with an unfamiliar energy.

${grandparent}’s gaze softened, and for the first time, I saw a hint of something deeper in $!{pospronoun} eyes—something not just filled with pride, but with… worry?

“Well, ${user_name},” $!{pronoun} began slowly, $!{pospronoun} tone a touch more serious than before. “What you just did wasn’t some beginner’s trick. What you did is something far bigger. Something far older.”

I frowned. “Bigger? Older? What are you talking about?”

*page_break Archons

$!{pronoun} sighed deeply, a long, tired sound. “Listen, I’ve lived a long time, and I’ve seen a lot of things. But nothing quite like this. What you’ve just done... that’s not something you learn overnight. You’ve been blessed.”

I blinked, processing the word. Blessed. “Blessed?” I repeated, my voice barely a whisper. “Like, with magic?”

${grandparent}’s eyes locked onto mine, $!{pospronoun} gaze intense, and for the first time, I could see the weight of centuries in $!{pospronoun} eyes. “Not just any magic, ${user_name}. Blessings. Not everyone gets them. Most never even know they exist. It’s rare. Extremely rare. It’s like the gods themselves are reaching down, choosing someone to carry a part of their power.”

“Gods?” I repeated, incredulous. “Like… the ones from the old stories?”

$!{pronoun} nodded gravely. “Exactly. Some call them Celestials, or Archons. But they’re more than just stories. And for some reason, they’ve chosen you.”

I took a step back, my heart pounding in my chest. I felt like I was on the edge of something I didn’t understand. Celestials. Blessings. It all sounded like something from a dream—or a nightmare.

“But why me?” I asked, my voice cracking with disbelief. “I didn’t even know magic was real until I got here. I didn’t ask for this. I don’t even know what to do with it.”

${grandparent}’s face softened as $!{pronoun} looked at me, $!{pospronoun} expression filled with a mix of pity and understanding. “I don’t know why, ${user_name}. Not exactly. But blessings aren’t random. They’re tied to who you are—your heart, your ambitions, your soul. And the element you’re blessed with…” $!{pronoun} paused, $!{pospronoun} eyes drifting down to the water, as if weighing $!{pospronoun} next words carefully. “The element you’re blessed with reflects the core of who you are. Hydromancy. Water. It’s not weak, no matter what anyone might say. Water is balance. It’s persistence. It’s life itself.”

I swallowed hard, processing $!{pospronoun} words. Balance. Persistence. Life itself. It was hard to grasp. I’d just been a normal guy, stumbling through life, and now I was supposed to be the Chosen One wielding the power of water? It felt like a cruel joke, and yet, something inside me—deep inside—felt like I had always known this was my path. Like it had been waiting for me all along.

“But…” I hesitated, struggling to find the right words. “What does this mean for me? What am I supposed to do now?”

${grandparent} stepped closer, placing a firm hand on my shoulder. “For now, ${user_name}? We figure it out together. You might not know it yet, but this is a big deal. A huge deal. A blessing… That’s something most people never see in their lifetime.”

I nodded slowly, the enormity of it all settling into my bones. My chest tightened as I looked down at my hands, faint traces of water still trailing from my fingertips. But beneath the weight of ${grandparent}’s words, I felt a strange sense of clarity—like this was only the beginning.

Somewhere, deep inside me, I felt that quiet pull again. The voice. The word.

[i]"Chosen."[/i]

It resonated in my mind like a soft, unyielding wave, just beneath the surface. The water that was now a part of me, that would always be a part of me.

But that voice… I didn’t know what it meant, and I certainly didn’t know what was coming next. I only knew that it felt like a call—an invitation to something much larger than myself.

I didn’t know how, but somehow, I was about to find out.

*page_break ${grandparent}'s Blessing

The sun was beginning its descent when ${grandparent} motioned for me to follow $!{objpronoun}. I was still trying to wrap my head around what had happened earlier, the strange feeling of power that surged through me when I managed to make the river water stir with a flick of my hand. My fingers tingled with an energy I hadn’t felt before, and the world around me seemed a little more... vibrant. But the pull of magic wasn’t something I could ignore now, especially after what ${grandparent} had told me.

“Come on, ${user_name},” ${grandparent} said, $!{pospronoun} voice light, but there was something in $!{pospronoun} eyes—something serious—that made me pause.

“What’s going on, ${grandparent}?” I asked, feeling the weight of the afternoon’s strange events pulling at me. $!{pospronoun} serious expression was rare, and it unnerved me.

$!{pronoun} motioned for me to sit down next to $!{objpronoun} on the old wooden bench by the side of the river. The breeze rustled the trees around us, and the sound of the water flowing nearby seemed to steady my pulse, though the questions bubbling inside me refused to quiet.

“I need to tell you something,” ${grandparent} started, glancing at me as if weighing $!{pospronoun} words. “You’re not the first one in this family to have... a blessing.”

My heart skipped a beat. “A blessing?” I asked, surprised. “What do you mean? You have one too?”

$!{pronoun} nodded, a small smile pulling at $!{pospronoun} lips. “I was hoping you wouldn’t find out until you were ready, but it seems like that day has come sooner than expected.” $!{pronoun} raised $!{pospronoun} hand, palm facing upwards, and the air around $!{objpronoun} seemed to hum with an almost imperceptible energy.

At first, nothing happened. I waited, confused, and then the atmosphere shifted, thickening with tension. A crackle, like a thunderclap in the distance, echoed through the air, and to my amazement, arcs of pale blue electricity danced around ${grandparent}’s fingertips. The air seemed to shimmer with the energy, casting an ethereal glow over $!{pospronoun} weathered skin.

“You… you can do that?” I breathed, my voice barely a whisper as I stared at the display of power. The very idea of someone wielding electricity like this seemed impossible, yet here it was, right in front of me.

${grandparent}’s grin widened. “Yep. Electromancy. A little something I’ve had since I was your age. Didn’t even know what was happening at first—thought I had been struck by lightning or something.” $!{pronoun} chuckled at the memory, brushing $!{pospronoun} hand through the air as the sparks fizzled out.

I sat there, stunned. It was one thing to hear about magic, but to see it... “But, you never said anything about this before. Why not?”

$!{pospronoun} expression grew thoughtful, almost solemn. “Because it’s not just about the power, ${user_name}. A blessing, it’s a responsibility, a calling. It changes you. I didn’t want to burden you with that until you were ready to understand.”

*page_break Responsibility

I blinked, trying to grasp the gravity of what $!{pronoun} was saying. “A responsibility... but why didn’t you tell me sooner?”

${grandparent}’s gaze softened. “Because I wasn’t sure if you’d be ready for it. You had to see it for yourself, and now you have. And now you understand that it’s not just about what you can do with magic, but about who you’re becoming. Your gift... it reflects who you are, what you’re meant to do.”

I looked at my hands again, still feeling that lingering warmth from the water I’d controlled earlier, but now it seemed different. More powerful, more real. The water seemed to respond to me, like it was attuned to my very being. I swallowed hard. “So... this blessing—what am I supposed to do with it?”

${grandparent}’s eyes twinkled with a knowing look, and for a moment, the playful glint returned to $!{pospronoun} expression. “For now? You figure it out. It’ll take time. Just like I had to learn to harness my power. But one thing I can tell you for sure—there’s no going back from this. This power, it’s yours now. And it’s going to shape who you become.”

I nodded slowly, trying to digest the weight of $!{pospronoun} words. The thought of having this ability, this connection to the elements, was overwhelming. And knowing that ${grandparent} had once been in the same position as me—unaware and then suddenly thrust into this responsibility—was both comforting and daunting at the same time.

“But ${grandparent},” I asked, a nagging thought still eating at me, “why me? You said this blessing isn’t common. What makes me special?”

${grandparent}’s gaze softened, and $!{pronoun} sighed, rubbing the back of $!{pospronoun} neck. “That’s the question, isn’t it? Magic doesn’t choose just anyone. It’s... not random. It’s tied to something deeper inside of you, something in your heart. The element you’re connected to—it’s a reflection of who you are. And you, ${user_name}... I think you’re someone the world is going to need.”

*page_break

I stared at $!{objpronoun}, unsure how to process this. “But... how am I supposed to know what to do with all this?”

${grandparent} smiled faintly, $!{pospronoun} hand resting on my shoulder. “Don’t worry about the big picture just yet. Take it one step at a time. Learn to control it. Learn to trust it. And most importantly, learn to trust yourself. The rest will come.”

I was silent for a moment, trying to absorb everything. The voice inside my head, the pull I’d felt in the water, and now this revelation about ${grandparent}... it felt like my entire world was shifting, like something bigger was unfolding, and I wasn’t sure how to navigate it.

${grandparent} cleared $!{pospronoun} throat, $!{pospronoun} voice now serious once more. “I never had anyone to help me when I first discovered my blessing. I had to learn on my own. But you... you’ve got me. And we’ll figure this out together.”

I looked up at $!{objpronoun}, the sense of comfort $!{pospronoun} words brought slowly sinking in. It was strange, knowing that my life had just changed in ways I couldn’t yet understand, but having ${grandparent} by my side made the weight of it all feel a little less crushing.

“Thanks, $!{grandparent},” I said quietly, my voice thick with emotion.

*page_break

$!{pronoun} chuckled and ruffled my hair. “Don’t thank me yet, ${user_name}. You’ve got a long way to go before you figure this all out. But you’ll be all right. You’ve got the will. And that’s more than most people have.”

I smiled, feeling the warmth of $!{pospronoun} encouragement. The sun was setting now, the sky turning to hues of purple and gold, casting a soft glow on everything around us. The river flowed peacefully beside us, a quiet reminder of the forces I was now tied to. My blessing was just beginning, and though I didn’t know what lay ahead, one thing was certain—I wouldn’t face it alone.

${grandparent}’s voice broke the silence, light and teasing again. “So, ${user_name}... you ready to see if you can take on lightning with water?”

I grinned back at $!{objpronoun}, a small spark of excitement flickering inside me. “Maybe, but I think I’ll stick to mastering the water first.”

$!{pronoun} chuckled, clapping me on the back. “That’s the spirit.”

As we sat there together, the weight of the afternoon’s revelations settled, and a sense of purpose slowly began to form within me. The journey ahead wouldn’t be easy, but for the first time, I felt ready to face whatever came next.

[b]That night..[/b]

The smell of fish roasting over the crackling flames filled the air. The flickering firelight danced across the clearing as night settled in. ${grandparent} had gone off to gather more firewood, leaving me alone with the roasting station.  

The fish sat skewered over the small fire, sizzling faintly as the juices dripped into the flames. I stared at the weak fire, its orange glow barely enough to cook the fish evenly. My stomach growled, and I sighed.  

“Come on, fire… just burn a little hotter,” I muttered to myself, poking at it with a stick. But the flames remained pitiful.  

A thought struck me. I glanced at the fire and then at my hands. If hydromancy came to me earlier… maybe… just maybe…

$!{grandparent} knelt beside me, $!{pospronoun} Electromancy crackling as $!{pronoun} smothered the remaining flames. $!{pospronoun} gaze locked onto my outstretched hand, $!{pospronoun} expression unreadable.  

“Two elements…?” $!{pronoun} muttered. “But that’s…”  

$!{pospronoun} voice trailed off, and for the first time, I saw something in $!{pospronoun} face I’d never seen before. Not anger. Not frustration.  

Fear.  

*choice  
    # “$!{grandparent}…? What aren’t you telling me?”  
        $!{pronoun} exhaled heavily, raking a hand through $!{pospronoun} graying hair. The usual sharpness in $!{pospronoun} eyes dulled, replaced by something deeper—something wounded.  

        “Your mother… she was like you,” $!{pronoun} murmured. “Defiant. Brilliant. She had a gift that should’ve been impossible. And because of it… the world tried to take her from me.”  

        $!{pronoun} looked away, jaw tightening. “I won’t let them take you too.”  

        $!{pospronoun} grip on my shoulder was firm—protective, almost desperate. For the first time, the man who had always seemed unshakable… looked afraid.

        $!{pospronoun} gaze drifted away, $!{pospronoun} jaw clenching. “I won’t let that happen to you.”  

        $!{pospronoun} hand tightened on my shoulder—steady, but filled with unspoken fear. For the first time, the man who had always been my pillar… looked shaken.

The air around us grew thick with an unspoken weight, like the world itself was holding its breath. $!{grandparent}’s usual unyielding gaze softened, like the storm inside $!{objpronoun} was finally starting to calm—though I knew it wasn’t gone.

“You don’t know the whole story, do you?” $!{pospronoun} voice was low, tinged with something darker, something heavy. “Your mother... she wasn’t just a mage. She was part of something much bigger. Something hidden, something forgotten.”

I blinked, a chill creeping down my spine. What was $!{pronoun} talking about? The more $!{pronoun} spoke, the more I felt like I was standing on the edge of something I couldn’t yet understand.

$!{pronoun} paused, eyes glinting with a mix of sorrow and regret. “Before the war broke out... before everything was lost, your mother was part of a secret group—The Royal Knights Council. Not the one everyone knows. The real one. The one that protected the throne from the shadows.”

I didn’t say anything, but my mind was racing. Protecting the throne? What did that even mean? And why was $!{pronoun} telling me this now?

$!{grandparent}’s gaze hardened. “They weren’t just protectors. They were warriors, mages—sworn to defend the kingdom. But when the Obsidian Court started moving, they realized something bigger was coming. A threat that could destroy everything. So they did what they had to do. They cast a forbidden magic.”

I froze, my pulse quickening. Forbidden magic? The weight of those words sank deep into my chest.

*page_break Forbidden...

“They summoned a hero,” $!{pronoun} said slowly, as if tasting the very idea. “A last-ditch effort to stop the Obsidian Court and defend the throne. But it failed.” $!{pronoun} met my eyes, and for a moment, I saw the doubt flicker there—like $!{pronoun} didn’t fully believe what $!{pronoun} was saying. “Or at least, that’s what it seemed like. The magic ripped the sky open, and in the blink of an eye, the world was… gone.”

Gone? What did that mean? Was $!{pronoun} talking about the explosion—the Chronos Magic that tore apart everything?

$!{grandparent}’s expression twisted with pain. “Everyone died. Heroes. Villains. The throne. Everything. All swallowed by that explosion, that… nuke. It was as if the world was just sucked away, vanished in a blink.”

$!{pronoun} fell silent, the words hanging in the air like a weight none of us could lift. I didn’t speak. I couldn’t. I didn’t understand, not really. But I could see the truth in $!{pospronoun} eyes—$!{grandparent} knew something bigger was at play.

“There’s just one thing I don’t get,” $!{grandparent} muttered, $!{pospronoun} voice heavy with confusion. “You... you were born before all of that happened. Before the war. Yet, when you came into this world, you were… unconscious. Your mother sent you to me—before everything. Before the attack, before the war, before it all.” $!{pronoun} paused, looking at me with a strange mix of fear and hope. “And now, all these years later, here you are—alive, but still… so different.”

My heart skipped a beat. $!{pronoun} was talking about me, wasn’t $!{pronoun}? $!{pronoun} didn’t know it yet, but I was the one who’d lived before. The one who had been sent back.

$!{grandparent}’s voice shook slightly as $!{pronoun} continued. “I’ve tried to make sense of it. I’ve wondered if there’s some connection between your birth and the prophecy that’s been spoken of for centuries. Something about a child born before the war... one who would be the vessel for something much larger than anyone could imagine. A hero... a descender.”

A descender. My blood ran cold. $!{pronoun} couldn’t know. $!{pronoun} couldn’t possibly understand what $!{pronoun} was talking about.

$!{grandparent}’s eyes searched mine, but I stayed silent, unable to say a word. I couldn’t let $!{objpronoun} know, not yet. Not with everything still so... uncertain.

The fire crackles softly as exhaustion finally catches up to me. The day's events weigh heavily on my mind—$!{grandparent}' cryptic warnings, Elara's knowing glances, the whispers of prophecy lingering in the air. My eyelids grow heavy, and I curl up under the blanket, letting the warmth envelop me.

Just as consciousness begins to slip away, a voice cuts through the silence—a calm, measured tone tinged with amusement.

"Sage here. Or should I say... overseer of your journey?"

I jolt upright, startled. "Who's there?"

A soft chuckle echoes in my mind. "Relax, Descender. No need for alarm. I am Sage, your guide through this realm. Think of me as... a companion of sorts. Though perhaps 'semi-formal assistant' suits better."

Her words are smooth, almost teasing, yet oddly comforting. It feels like she knows far more than she lets on.

"If you wish to learn more—or simply indulge your curiosity—you may access our conversations anytime via the Stats screen. For now, rest. But first..."

She pauses briefly, her tone shifting ever so slightly.

"Care to ask me anything? Consider it a courtesy for enduring such a chaotic arrival."

        "Who—or what—are you, really?"

The first rays of sunlight filter through the stained-glass windows of the church, casting colorful patterns across the wooden floor. You stir in your makeshift bed—a pile of blankets near the altar—and stretch lazily. The faint scent of roasted fish still lingers in the air, mingling with the earthy aroma of old books and incense. 

$!{grandparent} is already awake, seated at a small table by the firepit. $!{pronoun}’s tinkering with something metallic, muttering under $!{pospronoun} breath as sparks fly from $!{pospronoun} hands. Magic crackles softly around $!{objpronoun}, illuminating $!{pospronoun} weathered face. It’s clear $!{pronoun}’s been up for hours, lost in thought—or perhaps avoiding sleep altogether.

Elara isn’t far away either. She sits cross-legged on the other side of the room, carefully arranging freshly baked bread onto a tray. Her movements are deliberate, almost meditative, and she hums a quiet melody as she works. Even though she appears no older than six or seven, there’s a timeless grace about her that hints at her true elven nature.

You yawn loudly, drawing their attention. $!{grandparent} glances over briefly before returning to $!{pospronoun} work, but Elara smiles warmly.

“Good morning, sleepyhead,” she says, placing the last loaf onto the tray. “Hungry? There’s plenty to eat.”

What do you do?

        You catch the bread mid-air—or rather, it lands squarely on your head—but the gesture makes you grin.  

        *goto activity_options

    #Crawl toward $!{grandparent} to see what $!{pronoun}’s working on.
        On all fours, you make your way to $!{grandparent}’ side, peering curiously at the glowing contraption in $!{pospronoun} hands. It looks like a mix between a compass and a clock, its surface etched with runes that pulse faintly with light.  
        
        “Careful, kid,” $!{pronoun} warns, nudging you back gently. “This thing’s delicate. Wouldn’t want you breaking it before we even figure out what it does.”  
        
        Despite $!{pospronoun} gruff tone, you notice a hint of pride in $!{pospronoun} eyes as $!{pronoun} explains:  
        
        “It’s supposed to detect magical disturbances. Might come in handy if we run into trouble.”  

        *goto activity_options

    #Waddle over to Elara and sniff the bread.
        You toddle unsteadily toward Elara, drawn by the irresistible smell of freshly baked goods. When you reach her, you lean forward and take a deep sniff, earning a laugh from the young elf.  
        
        “You really are a bottomless pit, aren’t you?” she jokes, handing you a small slice of bread. “Here, try this. But don’t choke—it’s still warm!”  
        
        The bread melts in your mouth, soft and slightly sweet. You give her a toothy grin, which she returns with a playful wink.

After breakfast, the three of you settle into a comfortable rhythm. $!{grandparent} continues fiddling with $!{pospronoun} device, occasionally muttering calculations under $!{pospronoun} breath. Elara tidies up the space, humming softly as she moves. Meanwhile, you sit cross-legged on the floor, watching the interplay of light and shadow dance across the walls.

Eventually, $!{grandparent} sets down $!{pospronoun} project and clears $!{pospronoun} throat.  

“Alright, kiddo,” $!{pronoun} begins, leaning back in $!{pospronoun} chair. “We can’t stay cooped up in here forever. What do you say we get some fresh air today?”

Elara nods in agreement, brushing crumbs off her apron.  

“There’s plenty to do outside,” she adds. “Whether it’s exploring the forest, practicing magic, or helping me gather herbs, the choice is yours.”

The biting chill of the night air seeped through the thin walls of the small dining hall, a stark contrast to the lingering warmth of the day. The single flickering lantern hanging above the rough-hewn wooden table cast long, dancing shadows that stretched and contorted across the room, making the familiar surroundings seem subtly menacing. Outside, the wind whispered through the trees, sounding eerily like hushed voices. The only other light came from the warm glow emanating from the kitchen, where the nuns were quietly cleaning up after the meal.

A simple, steaming pot roast sat at the center of the table, its aroma filling the air. Tonight's dinner was a humble affair: tender chunks of beef, slow-cooked with carrots, potatoes, and onions in a rich, savory gravy. The vegetables were soft and infused with the flavor of the meat, the gravy thick and fragrant. A basket of crusty bread, perfect for soaking up the delicious sauce, sat beside it.

You had helped earlier in the day gathering some of the ingredients, and you'd even contributed a few techniques you remembered from your previous life. A touch of rosemary to enhance the earthy notes, a hint of red wine to deepen the richness of the gravy… small touches that elevated the simple dish. You had even shown the nuns how to sear the beef before adding it to the pot, a technique that created a deep, caramelized crust and added layers of flavor. Sister Lyra, with her striking, almost otherworldly beauty – her features sharp and elegant, her skin possessing a subtle, pearly sheen that hinted at her elven heritage – had seemed particularly interested in your culinary wisdom. Her violet eyes, so intense and observant, sparkled with… something. (Okay, focus. It's just the good food talking. And maybe a little bit of elven charm.)

$!{grandparent}, seated at the head of the table, offered a silent blessing before picking up $!{pospronoun} spoon. The nuns followed suit, their movements graceful and reverent. You took a deep breath, the fragrant steam warming your face, and ladled a generous portion of the pot roast onto your plate. The first bite was a revelation. The beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender, the vegetables perfectly cooked, and the subtle blend of herbs and spices created a symphony of flavors that danced on your tongue. It was comfort food elevated to an art form.

The conversation around the table was light and easy, a comfortable rhythm of shared stories and gentle laughter. But as the meal progressed, a subtle shift occurred. The laughter faded, replaced by an unspoken tension. The shadows in the room seemed to deepen, the wind outside growing louder, more insistent. A chill settled over the table, a coldness that had nothing to do with the night air. Even the warm glow from the kitchen seemed to dim, casting the dining hall into an unsettling twilight.

    #The sudden cold.
        A sudden gust of cold air sweeps through the dining hall, raising goosebumps on your arms.

    #The silence.
        An unnatural silence descends upon the room, broken only by the wind's mournful cries. Even the clinking of cutlery has ceased.

        The once-delicious pot roast now seems unappetizing, the aroma turning faintly metallic.

[i][Sage] Scanning… Multiple magical signatures detected. The familiar signatures are $!{grandparent} and the nuns.

*label sage_assessment
[i][Sage] The situation is precarious. An ancient power has awakened.  Its presence is unsettling, a disruption to the natural balance. I cannot yet determine its exact nature or intentions, but its power is undeniable.  We must proceed with caution.[/i]

*goto continue_ominous

*label sage_danger
[i][Sage] There is a sense of… unease, a palpable tension in the air.  I wouldn't say there is *immediate* physical danger, but the presence of such a powerful entity is inherently risky.  Its influence could manifest in unpredictable ways.  Be vigilant.[/i]

*goto continue_ominous

*label sage_unknown
[i][Sage] The faint, obscured signature is difficult to pinpoint.  It's almost like… a reflection, a distorted echo of your own magical energy.  The powerful signature, however, is unmistakably ancient and malevolent.  It feels… connected to the forest, as if it's been slumbering there for centuries, perhaps millennia.  I cannot definitively say if it's hostile, but its power is immense, and its awakening is a cause for concern.[/i]

*goto continue_ominous

*label sage_ward
[i][Sage] I can create a temporary ward, a shield against immediate magical influence.  However, it will require a significant expenditure of energy on my part, and it will only offer limited protection against such a powerful entity.  It's a precaution, not a guarantee of safety.  (Casting ward...) The ward is in place.  It will last for approximately one hour.[/i]

[i][Sage] The familiar signatures are $!{grandparent} and the nuns.  They seem…disturbed, but otherwise unharmed.  They are likely sensing the same disturbance as we are.[/i]

You tried to sit up, but your body felt foreign, uncooperative. Muscles that should have obeyed refused to respond properly, leaving you wobbling like a newborn fawn. Before frustration could take hold, $!{grandparent} appeared at your side, $!{pospronoun} calloused hands steadying you. $!{pospronoun} touch was firm yet gentle, grounding you in this strange new reality.

“There we go,” $!{pronoun} muttered under $!{pospronoun} breath, more to $!{reflexive} than to you. “Easy now.”

With $!{pospronoun} help, you managed to stand on shaky legs. The ground beneath your feet was uneven, littered with debris—splintered wood, shards of pottery, scraps of fabric—all remnants of something once whole, now broken. You glanced around, taking in the devastation.

*fake_choice
    #Look closer at the debris.
        You focus on the scattered remains, noticing fragments of tools, shattered furniture, and even a child’s doll half-buried in the dirt. Each piece tells a story of lives interrupted.
        *goto village_scene
    #Take a deep breath to steady yourself.
        The air smells of ash and damp earth, heavy with the weight of loss. It grounds you, reminding you that survival is possible—even here.
        *goto village_scene
    #Try to walk without $!{grandparent}' help.
        You take a tentative step forward, only to stumble slightly. $!{grandparent} catches you just in time, $!{pospronoun} grip firm but reassuring.
        *goto village_scene

*label village_scene

The village looked like it had been torn apart by some great force. What remained of the cottages were skeletal frames, their walls blackened from fire or collapsed entirely. Roofs sagged precariously, held together only by sheer luck—or perhaps stubbornness. Smoke still curled lazily into the sky from smoldering piles of rubble, though most of the flames had long since died out.

To your left, the bakery stood half-collapsed, its stone oven cracked and cold. A single loaf of bread lay forgotten on the ground nearby, dusted with ash. To your right, the well—the heart of any village—was shattered, its wooden bucket lying uselessly beside the splintered rim. Water pooled around it, reflecting the pale morning light like spilled silver.

But it wasn’t just the buildings that told the story of destruction. It was the people—or rather, the absence of them. The streets were eerily quiet, save for the occasional creak of a loose shutter swaying in the breeze. Those who hadn’t fled during the attack now moved cautiously among the ruins, their faces etched with exhaustion and grief. Some carried tools, attempting to salvage what little they could; others simply wandered aimlessly, staring blankly at the wreckage as if searching for answers written in the ashes.

In the distance, the sanctuary—a place you vaguely remembered as a symbol of hope and safety—was barely recognizable. Its grand double doors hung crookedly on rusted hinges, and the stained-glass windows that once depicted scenes of triumph and faith were reduced to jagged fragments. The altar inside was overturned, its surface scorched and cracked. Even the statues of revered saints stood decapitated, their hollow eyes seeming to accuse the heavens themselves.

Despite the ruin, there were signs of life trying to claw its way back. Villagers worked tirelessly, their movements mechanical but determined. One woman knelt by a pile of stones, carefully stacking them to form the foundation of a new wall. Nearby, two children played quietly, using sticks to draw patterns in the dirt. Their laughter was soft, hesitant, as though they feared disturbing the fragile peace.

$!{grandparent} guided you forward, $!{pospronoun} grip steady but not overbearing. As you took your first steps into the ravaged village, you couldn’t shake the feeling that this place was holding its breath, waiting for something—or someone—to restore balance. The air hummed faintly, charged with an energy you didn’t fully understand yet. It was as if the land itself was alive, whispering secrets only you could hear.

Your gaze drifted upward, past the jagged rooftops and leaning chimneys, toward the horizon. Beyond the village, the forest loomed dark and foreboding, its trees standing sentinel against the gray sky. Something about it unsettled you, though you couldn’t say why. Maybe it was the way the shadows seemed to shift when no one was looking. Or maybe it was the faint glimmer of glowing mushrooms peeking through the underbrush, their eerie luminescence pulsing like a heartbeat.

For a moment, you forgot how to breathe. This wasn’t just a village recovering from disaster—it was a battlefield scarred by loss, resilience, and unanswered questions. And somehow, inexplicably, you knew this was where your journey truly began.

*fake_choice
    #Ask $!{grandparent} about the forest.
        “Why does the forest feel... wrong?” you manage to ask. $!{grandparent} hesitates, $!{pospronoun} jaw tightening before $!{pronoun} replies, “It’s not the forest you need to worry about. It’s what’s watching from within.”
        *goto next_step1
    #Focus on the glowing mushrooms.
        The mushrooms pulse rhythmically, almost hypnotically. You wonder if they’re natural—or something far more sinister.
        *goto next_step1
    #Turn your attention back to the villagers.
        Their quiet determination fills you with a sense of purpose. Whatever happened here, you vow to help them rebuild—and uncover the truth.

$!{grandparent} squeezed your shoulder lightly, pulling you back to the present. “We’ve got work to do,” $!{pronoun} said, $!{pospronoun} voice low but resolute. “Let’s start with clearing the debris. Every stone counts.”

You nodded, though your mind raced with thoughts you couldn’t quite articulate. Who had done this? Why? And why did it feel like the answers lay just beyond reach, hidden somewhere in the ruins?

As you bent down to pick up a piece of broken timber, you couldn't help but feel a pang of determination. Amidst the ashes and echoes of despair, you took your first step—not just toward rebuilding, but toward uncovering the truth buried beneath the rubble.
