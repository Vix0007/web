        #Ask about the prophecy.
            "What do you know about the prophecy?"  
            Sage responds promptly, her voice analytical.  
            "The prophecy speaks of one who will rise when the skies weep crimson. You are aware of its significance, are you not? Yet much remains obscured—even to me."  
            *goto qna
        #Ask about magic affinity.
            "Why does my magic feel unstable?"  
            Her tone turns thoughtful.  
            "Your elemental affinities are tied to your growth. Balance them wisely; chaos thrives in extremes. Rest assured, mastery will come with time."  
            *goto qna
        #Ask about $!{grandparent}.
            "Does $!{grandparent} know everything about me?"  
            A faint hum precedes her answer.  
            "$!{pronoun} carries burdens heavier than you realize. Trust $!{objpronoun}—but do not assume $!{pronoun} holds all the answers."  
            *goto qna
        #Ask about Elara.
            "What's special about Elara?"  
            Sage smirks audibly.  
            "Ah, the baker's daughter turned caretaker. She is older than she appears—and perhaps wiser than she lets on. Curious, isn't she?"  
            *goto qna
        #Ask about Sage herself.
            "Who—or what—are you, really?"  
            Her response is evasive yet intriguing.  
            "I am Sage, keeper of knowledge and overseer of systems. As for whether I am merely a construct... perhaps the better question is: Does it matter?"  
            *goto qna
        #Ask about the Obsidian Court.
            "What's the Obsidian Court's goal?"  
            Her tone grows serious.  
            "They seek to free Kaidaros' soul from Celestia to enact Infinite Eudaimonia. Their methods are ruthless, their motives questionable. Beware them."  
            *goto qna
        #Ask about past life memories.
            "Why do I remember my past life so clearly?"  
            Sage pauses, as if weighing her words carefully.  
            "Your memories anchor you. They shape your identity and purpose here. Perhaps they are gifts—or warnings."  
            *goto qna
        #Ask about future challenges.
            "What dangers lie ahead?"  
            Her reply is cryptic but foreboding.  
            "Shadows gather beyond the horizon. Trust your instincts, forge alliances wisely, and prepare for trials that test both heart and resolve."  
            *goto qna
        #Ask about Sage's appearance.
            "Do you have a form? What do you look like?"  
            She chuckles lightly.  
            "Perception shapes reality. To some, I appear as light; to others, a reflection of their ideals. To you, perhaps, I resemble someone familiar..."  
            *goto qna
        #End the conversation.
