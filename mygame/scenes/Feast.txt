As you bent down to pick up a piece of broken timber, you couldn't help but feel a pang of determination. Amidst the ashes and echoes of despair, you took your first step—not just toward rebuilding, but toward uncovering the truth buried beneath the rubble.  
*label rebuilding  

*fake_choice  
  *disable_reuse #Examine the fallen bakery first.  
    The scent of burnt bread and ash still lingered in the air, heavy and suffocating, as though the fire had only recently been extinguished. The once-proud stone oven now stood cracked and cold, its mouth yawning open like a broken maw. A single loaf of bread lay forgotten on the ground nearby, dusted with ash, its crust charred black but somehow untouched by scavengers or time.

    Something about the wreckage felt… off. It wasn’t just the destruction—it was the way the debris seemed almost deliberate, as if someone (or something) had torn through here with purpose. Shattered shelves leaned precariously against scorched walls, their contents spilled across the floor: bags of flour reduced to gray powder, jars of honey smashed into sticky pools that gleamed faintly under the pale morning light.

    You step closer, your boots crunching softly over shards of pottery and splintered wood. The silence presses down on you, broken only by the distant creak of loose shutters swaying in the breeze. As you move deeper into the ruins, you notice faint marks etched into the stones near the base of the oven—symbols that look vaguely familiar yet alien at the same time.

    What do you want to do?

    *fake_choice
        #Inspect the strange symbols carved into the stones.
            You kneel down for a closer look, brushing away layers of soot and ash to reveal intricate patterns spiraling around each other. They seem ancient, pulsing faintly with an energy you can't quite explain. Could these be magical runes? Or perhaps remnants of some ritual gone wrong?
            
            Sage's voice echoes softly in your mind:  
            [i]"These markings are tied to old magic—a language long forgotten. Be cautious; such things often carry unintended consequences."[/i]
            
            Do you wish to touch them?
            
            *fake_choice
                #Touch the symbols cautiously.
                    Your fingers graze the surface of the stone, sending a jolt of warmth coursing through your arm. For a brief moment, the world blurs, and you see flashes of another place—a towering hall filled with flames, figures chanting in unison, and a shadowy figure standing at the center, arms raised high.
                    
                    Then, just as suddenly, the vision fades, leaving you breathless and disoriented. Whatever those symbols were meant to do, they clearly hold power far beyond your understanding.

                    Better safe than sorry. You withdraw your hand quickly, shaking off the lingering tingling sensation. These symbols might hold answers—or they could unleash something dangerous. Either way, you're not ready to find out yet.

                #Pick up the abandoned loaf of bread.
                    You reach down and pick up the loaf.  It's surprisingly… intact.  Not charred, not covered in ash, not even slightly warm.  It looks like it could have been baked this morning, if this morning hadn't involved a goblin invasion and the fiery collapse of the bakery. It's almost unsettling how untouched it is, like a beacon of normalcy in the surrounding chaos. It even smells faintly of yeast, which, considering the current circumstances, is comforting.
                
                    [i] Sage : That's… remarkable.  It's as if it was untouched by the disaster.  Perhaps a small blessing amidst the devastation.[/i]

                            Something compels you to tuck the loaf into your satchel, despite its weight and uselessness. Perhaps it will serve as a reminder of resilience, a symbol of hope amidst despair. Or maybe it’s just a small piece of the past you can't bear to leave behind.

                            With a sigh, you place the loaf back on the ground.  It feels wrong to take it, somehow. It belongs here, amidst the ruins, a silent testament to what was.  Still, as you walk away, you can't shake the feeling that you've missed an opportunity somehow.  Maybe it was a message. Maybe it was a sign.  Or maybe it was just a remarkably well-preserved loaf of bread.
                
                            [i] Sage: A thoughtful choice, ${user_name}. Sometimes, leaving things undisturbed is a form of respect.  Though, I admit, its condition is… curious.[/i]

            You begin rummaging through the wreckage, tossing aside chunks of rubble and sifting through piles of ash. Most of what you find is useless—shattered crockery, melted metal tools—but then your hand brushes against something cool and smooth buried beneath the debris.
        
            Pulling it free, you discover a small glass vial half-filled with a shimmering golden liquid. The substance inside glows faintly, casting dancing reflections onto your skin. What could this be? Some kind of potion? Or perhaps a remnant of whatever caused the destruction here?
        
            What would you like to do?

                            [i] Sage: A prudent decision, ${user_name}. Unidentified magical artifacts are best left undisturbed, especially in such… volatile times. Though, I confess, my curiosity is piqued.[/i]

    *page_break Thank you, next..
    As you finish exploring the bakery, you glance back one last time. The crumbling structure seems to sag further under the weight of its own ruin, whispering secrets of a life extinguished too soon. Whatever happened here, it left scars—not just on the building, but on the very fabric of the village itself.

    With a final pang of determination, you turn away, ready to face whatever comes next.

  *disable_reuse #Approach the broken well.  
    A figure by the well, small and indistinct at this distance, seemed to be observing the ravaged village with an unnerving calm. The broken cobblestones and scattered debris glistened under a pale, uncertain light, as if the ruins themselves whispered secrets of a forgotten past.

    *page_break
    The ruined square stretched before you, a silent testament to the battle. But it wasn't the destruction that held your attention. It was the figure by the well.  Hesitation warred with an unseen pull, urging you closer.  Each step felt heavy, the crunch of rubble beneath your boots echoing in the stillness.  As you approached, the figure sharpened—a young woman, her sapphire robe stained with dust, yet somehow still radiating an air of nobility.  Her gaze was fixed on the horizon, lost in some distant thought.
    
    *page_break
    The woman stood close now, a quiet strength in her posture. But there was a weariness too, a subtle slump to her shoulders as if carrying an invisible burden.  She turned, her icy blue eyes meeting yours.  Curiosity flickered in their depths, but beneath it lay a current of sadness, a hint of something lost or broken.

    Her gaze held yours, a silent question hanging in the air. The wind whispered through the ruins, carrying the scent of ash and the faint echo of distant cries.  You felt a strange pull towards this young woman, a sense that her presence here was more than coincidence.

    *fake_choice
        # Greet her politely.
            You clear your throat, the sound surprisingly loud in the quiet square. "Good morning," you say, trying to keep your voice steady. "I noticed you here—are you searching for someone?"

"This is $!{objpronoun}.  Have you seen $!{objpronoun}?"

    Before you can answer, a shout echoes across the square. "${user_name}! We need you!" It's $!{grandparent}, $!{pospronoun} voice urgent. $!{pronoun}'s waving you over from near the collapsed apothecary.

    Celestine nods, her expression thoughtful. "I'll be here," she replies, clutching the locket tightly. "I have a feeling… this is important." She watches as you turn and hurry towards $!{grandparent}, a sense of anticipation, mixed with a touch of unease, settling over you. The image in the locket, though distorted, lingers in your mind. You do recognize that face… it's just a shame you can't quite place it.  It's like it's on the tip of your tongue… or maybe it's just a really blurry picture.

    You notice a woman struggling to rebuild a section of collapsed wall. Her hands are raw and bleeding, yet she works tirelessly, lifting stones twice her size. A flicker of determination, mixed with exhaustion, flickers in her eyes.

    *page_break

    You approach cautiously. "That looks like hard work," you say. "Would you like some help?"

    The woman glances up, her expression wary at first, then softening into a grateful smile. "I would be much obliged," she says, her voice hoarse. "This wall… it's all that's left of my home."

    Together, you begin to lift and place the heavy stones, working in comfortable silence for a while. The rhythmic thud of stone on stone fills the air, a small act of defiance against the surrounding destruction.  You notice the other villagers glancing your way, some offering nods of respect, others whispering – you catch snippets of phrases like "the hero" and "blessed by the spirits."  It seems word of your role in the battle has spread.

    *page_break

    As you work, you learn her name is Elina. She tells you about her life before the attack, her family, her hopes for the future. Her resilience and quiet strength inspire you. You realize that even amidst the devastation, these people are determined to rebuild, not just their homes, but their lives.

    "Thank you," she says, wiping sweat from her brow. "I don't know what I would have done without your help."

    "It's the least I could do," you reply.  An idea sparks in your mind.  "Actually," you continue, "I might have a few ideas that could make rebuilding a bit easier.  Back where I… come from, we have ways of reinforcing structures, making them more resistant to damage."

    Elina looks at you with interest. "Really? What kind of ways?"

    "Well," you explain, "one thing we could do is mix certain materials into the mortar to make it stronger.  We also use techniques to distribute weight more evenly, which prevents walls from collapsing so easily."  You demonstrate a simple way to interlock the stones, drawing on your understanding of modern construction principles.  "And," you add, thinking of your hydromancy, "I could also use my… abilities… to help with the heavier lifting and even create more mortar if we run short on water."

    Elina's eyes widen. "That would be… a miracle," she breathes.  "The spirits truly are watching over us."

    Other villagers gather around, listening intently.  You realize that your knowledge, though commonplace in your previous life, could be invaluable to these people.  Perhaps, beyond fighting monsters, you could help them rebuild, not just their homes, but their lives, making them stronger and more resilient than before.

    You approach the sanctuary, or what's left of it. The once-grand structure is now a skeletal ruin, its stone walls scarred and blackened, the roof mostly collapsed. Shattered stained glass lies scattered across the floor, reflecting twisted fragments of light – shards of vibrant color amidst the gray rubble.  The air here is heavy, thick with the scent of smoke and a lingering sense of loss.  A place of faith, now a relic, a monument to both devotion and destruction.

    *page_break

    As you step inside, the crunch of broken glass beneath your feet echoes through the ruined sanctuary.  Dust motes dance in the shafts of light that pierce the shattered windows, illuminating the devastation.  You see remnants of the altar, now overturned and broken, and fragments of what were once beautiful tapestries, now torn and faded.  A chilling silence hangs in the air, broken only by the occasional gust of wind whistling through the broken windows.

    *page_break

    You wander through the ruins, a sense of melancholy washing over you.  This place, once a sanctuary for the villagers, a symbol of hope and community, is now a casualty of the attack.  You notice a small, untouched section of stained glass depicting a celestial figure.  It's remarkably intact, a splash of vibrant blue in the surrounding ruin.  You reach out and gently touch the smooth surface, a flicker of warmth spreading through your fingertips.  As you do, a faint image flashes in your mind – a memory, not your own, of villagers singing hymns, their voices filled with faith and joy.  The image fades quickly, leaving you with a lingering sense of peace and a renewed determination to help rebuild.

The sun begins its descent, casting long shadows across the partially rebuilt village. The air is filled with the mingled scents of woodsmoke, freshly turned earth, and the tantalizing aroma of roasting meat. A large communal fire crackles merrily in the center of the village square, around which makeshift tables and benches have been arranged. It's not quite the grand village hall of old, but it's a start—a symbol of the community's resilience and a place to gather, share stories, and rebuild their lives. The new hall itself is rising steadily, its frame half-finished against the evening sky, a promise of better times to come.

You finish helping Elina secure a particularly stubborn stone, then wipe your hands on your trousers. The image of Celestine and the locket flickers in your mind. You promised to meet her at the well. A thought strikes you – perhaps you could invite her to join the evening meal. It would be a chance to talk more about the locket and… well, it *is* almost Valentine's Day.

You glance towards the well, a mix of anticipation and a touch of nervousness fluttering in your stomach. The setting sun paints the sky in vibrant hues of orange and purple, a beautiful backdrop for… well, for whatever might happen next.

*page_break

You take a deep breath and start walking towards the well, the sounds of laughter and conversation from the communal fire fading slightly with each step. As you approach, you see Celestine standing by the well, her silhouette outlined against the fiery sky.  She's looking out towards the horizon, a pensive expression on her face.

"It's beautiful, isn't it?" she says, glancing back at the sky. "It reminds me of… a feeling. A sense of peace I haven't felt in a long time."

You shrug lightly. "Yeah, it's pretty nice." The sun has fully set now, and the village has transformed. The sounds of hammering and sawing have ceased, replaced by the crackling of the large communal fire and the cheerful chatter of villagers. The air is thick with the mouthwatering aroma of roasted meat—a testament to a successful hunt. Smoke curls lazily upwards, mingling with the cool night air. Lanterns strung between the partially rebuilt structures cast a warm, inviting glow over the scene.

*page_break

It's a celebration, no doubt about it. A feast born from relief, gratitude, and the simple joy of survival. You see Elina laughing with her neighbors, her earlier weariness forgotten. Children chase each other around the fire, their faces smeared with dirt and streaks of celebratory paint. The atmosphere is electric, a palpable sense of shared relief and renewed hope. It's a far cry from the terror of the previous night.

You catch $!{grandparent}' eye. $!{pronoun}'s standing near the edge of the crowd, a broad smile on $!{pospronoun} face as $!{pronoun} watches you and Celestine. $!{pronoun} gives you a subtle thumbs-up. You smile back, a warm feeling spreading through your chest. Even Sage is quiet in your mind, a rare moment of peaceful stillness. You glimpse the nuns on the periphery of the gathering, their expressions serene as they observe the festivities.

*page_break

Celestine seems to be taking it all in, her eyes wide with a mixture of wonder and something akin to… longing? The aroma of the roasting meat seems to finally break her reverie. "That smells… incredible," she murmurs, her gaze fixed on the feast.

"It's a celebration," you explain. "We… we had a bit of a rough night." You gesture vaguely, not wanting to dwell on the details. "But everyone pulled together. We… we won."

"I can see that," Celestine says, her gaze sweeping over the scene. "There's a… a remarkable spirit here."

"Yeah," you agree.  "These people are… tough."  A thought crosses your mind. "Silvania… you said you're from Silvania, right? I don't think I've ever heard of it before."  *Or have I?* A faint, nagging feeling tugs at the edge of your memory.  A fleeting image of strange, glowing caves… but it's gone as quickly as it appears.

Celestine nods. "It's… a little different from here," she says, a hint of understatement in her voice. "It's… beyond the veil."

*page_break Beyond..

"Beyond the veil?" You frown. "What does that mean?" The image of the caves flashes again in your mind, stronger this time. You feel a shiver crawl down your spine. Did I… did I go there? But how? And when?  You shake your head, pushing the unsettling thought aside.  Tonight's for celebrating, you tell yourself. I can worry about that later.

"Never mind," you say to Celestine, forcing a smile. "Let's eat.  That food smells too good to resist."

*page_break Eat!

The feast is a lively affair.  Music fills the air, laughter rings out, and the aroma of roasted meat is intoxicating.  You fill a plate with food, making sure to grab some extra for Celestine.

        The aroma of the roasting meat is too tempting to resist. You head back to the serving area, where a mountain of food is laid out. Your stomach rumbles in anticipation. You spot platters piled high with roasted vegetables, baskets overflowing with bread, and… is that… satay? Your eyes widen. It's been ages since you've had satay.  The skewers of marinated meat, glistening with a savory peanut sauce, look absolutely irresistible.

        The village cook, a burly man with a soot-stained apron, notices you eyeing the satay. $!{pronoun} grins. "Ah, ${user_name}!" $!{pronoun} booms. "Glad you're back for more. This satay… it's a special batch. Remember that recipe you told me about, a while back? Before… well, before everything? I finally got around to trying it. Turns out, it's quite good!" $!{pronoun} chuckles.

        You grin back. You *do* remember. You'd shared a simplified version of a satay recipe with $!{objpronoun}, something you'd learned from your mother. You never expected $!{objpronoun} to actually make it.

        You close your eyes briefly, reaching out to Sage in your mind. Are you… alright? you ask.

        [i]Sage: Hmph. As if that is any of your concern.[/i] Her voice is sharp, but there’s an almost imperceptible pause. [i]I am merely… performing an advanced diagnostic. Nothing unusual.[/i]

        Oh? So, just a routine existential system check, then? You chuckle internally. And here I thought you were contemplating the mysteries of the cosmos or something.

        [i]Sage: Tch. As if someone like you could even begin to grasp such concepts. I am simply attuned to the world’s…* she hesitates for a fraction of a second, …energetic harmonics. Not that I need to explain myself to you![/i]

        Of course, of course. Definitely not because you’re bored and just don’t want to admit it. Or, I don’t know, maybe you were wondering if they’re serving dessert tonight?

        There’s silence. Then, a sharp mental huff.

        [i]Sage: Y-you’re being ridiculous! A being of my caliber has no need for such… trivial indulgences! Unlike you, I do not concern myself with base, earthly desires![/i]

        You swear you can almost feel her crossing her arms and turning away in a haughty sulk.

        Right, right. So I take it you won’t be interested if they have extra honey-glazed pastries?

        Another pause.

        [i]Sage: …I said desist! I have… far more important calculations to attend to! I am not listening to you anymore![/i]

        A complete radio silence follows—but somehow, you can feel her still lingering, waiting to hear if they do have dessert.

        You mingle with the villagers, sharing stories of the battle and listening to their tales of resilience. Old Man Tiber recounts how $!{pronoun} used $!{pospronoun} knowledge of the local terrain to guide a group of refugees to safety, while young Anya, eyes wide with wonder, describes witnessing you "wield the very water itself" to extinguish a raging fire.  There's laughter, celebrating their survival, but also tears for those they lost. You hear stories of families reunited, of neighbors helping neighbors, of ordinary people performing extraordinary acts of kindness.  Amidst the reminiscing, the conversation inevitably turns to the future—rebuilding homes, replanting fields, honoring the fallen. There's hope in their voices, a belief that even from the ashes, they can build something stronger. You realize that these people, once strangers, now feel like family. You've fought, laughed, and mourned alongside them. Their stories, hopes, and fears are now a part of you. The sense of community is strong, a bond forged in shared hardship and triumph, a bond that transcends blood and background, a shared vision of what's to come.

    *disable_reuse # Grab food for Celestine.
        You return to Celestine with a plate piled high with food. The aroma wafts through the air as you set it down in front of her.  

        "I hope you're hungry," you say, trying to sound casual. "This is the best we have to offer."  

        *page_break  

        Celestine glances at the plate, her violet eyes widening for just a fraction of a second before she quickly masks her surprise with an indifferent shrug.  

        "Hmph. It’s not like I was waiting or anything," she mutters under her breath, folding her arms across her chest. But then, almost reluctantly, she adds, "Not that I wasn’t… curious about what you were doing over there."  

        *page_break  

        She hesitates for a moment, her gaze flickering between the plate and your face. Her lips part as if she wants to say something more but stops herself. Instead, she picks up a fork with deliberate care, examining the dish like it’s some kind of ancient artifact.  

        "It looks... acceptable," she says finally, though the faint blush creeping onto her cheeks betrays her nonchalant tone. She takes a small bite, chewing slowly, as if savoring every morsel despite her efforts to seem unimpressed.  

        *page_break  

        After swallowing, she clears her throat and adjusts her posture, sitting up straighter as if reminding herself to act mature.  

        "I mean... it’s decent enough. Not bad for someone who probably doesn’t know much about fine dining."  

        She pauses, glancing at you from the corner of her eye. When you don’t respond immediately, she fidgets slightly, her composure slipping just a little.  

        *page_break  

        "Fine!" she blurts out, her voice rising unexpectedly. Realizing her outburst, she quickly reins it back in, lowering her tone.  

        "...Thank you. For bringing this. It’s... good."  

        She stabs another piece of food with her fork, avoiding direct eye contact, but you catch the hint of a smile tugging at the corners of her mouth.  

        *page_break  

        Her attempt at maturity cracks further when she lets out a tiny, involuntary hum of satisfaction after another bite.  

        She freezes mid-chew, clearly embarrassed by her own reaction, and hastily covers her mouth with one hand.  

        "W-What? Stop looking at me like that!" she snaps, though the effect is ruined by the warmth in her expression.  (+5 Celestine Affection)

You savor the delicious satay, enjoying the company of the villagers. As you finish eating, you realize you're still a bit peckish. And, thinking practically, you realize you might need some provisions for your journey ahead.

I'm listening, her voice echoes in your mind.

"I'm grabbing a few extra satay for later," you explain. "Could you… you know… administer them somewhere safe?  My satchel's getting a bit crowded."

Of course, Sage replies, a hint of amusement in her tone. Consider it done.

You discreetly gather a few more skewers of satay, wrapping them in a clean cloth.  As you tuck the bundle into your satchel, you feel a faint tingle, and the weight of the satay disappears.  It's as if they've vanished into thin air. +3 Satay (Void Inventory) you think to yourself, a mental note that Sage has taken care of it.

    # YESSS
        You close your eyes, reaching out to Sage in your mind. Sage. Question.

        [i] Sage : If it is another inane inquiry, I strongly suggest you refrain.[/i]

        How ‘admin’ are your admin powers? Like… could you just, I don’t know, grant me infinite power?

        [i] Sage: …What?[/i]

        Y’know, like—boom—limitless strength, god-tier magic, reality-warping abilities. Just press a button or something.

        [i] Sage: Do you truly believe omnipotence is something one simply hands out like confectionery!? Such absurdity! The very notion is—impossible! And even if it were not, I would never entrust such reckless authority to you.[/i]

        Pffft, rude. Fine, fine, no infinite power. What about something more reasonable? Like, I dunno… can you conjure a feast in front of me? A whole spread. Roasted meat, fresh bread, maybe some of that fancy celestial wine?

        [i] Sage : …I am not a personal chef. Nor am I a divine vending machine for your mortal cravings![/i]

        Alright, so no god powers, no food delivery. Man, what can you do?

        [i] Sage : FAR more than you are capable of comprehending! I am attuned to the very fabric of this world! I decipher the mysteries of the cosmos, unravel the threads of destiny, and—why are you smirking?[/i]

        Oh, nothing. Just admiring how dedicated you are. Really, Sage, you must be a master of divination… because every time I look into your eyes, I see my future.

        Silence. You wait.

        [i] Sage : …Wh—WHA—!?[/i]

        There it is. A distinct mental static flickers through your connection, like a system error, before Sage's voice returns—flustered and noticeably off-balance.

        [i] Sage : Y-You DARE direct such shameless nonsense at me?! Such a frivolous, utterly ridiculous—! Preposterous! Cease this immediately! I— I have no time for your insipid flirtations![/i]

        But you didn’t say I was wrong.

        [i] Sage : I WILL BANISH YOU TO THE AETHER![/i]
